<p>The payback period is used to evaluate the time it takes for an investment to<br />
recover its initial cost. It represents the length of time required for the cumulative<br />
cash inflows generated by an investment to equal its initial cash outflow. In other<br />
words, it measures how long it takes for an investment to &#8220;pay back&#8221; its original<br />
investment.</p>
<p>Payback Period = Initial Investment/ Annual Cash Inflow</p>
<p>The payback method is the easiest way of evaluating different projects /investments, and this is based on the Liquidity principle. The project is chosen, which provides a faster return on investment. More liquidity means more funds available to Invest in more projects. The management uses this to get a fast review of the project. Individuals use the payback approach to evaluate Investment decisions; too. It is based on a fundamental need to at least recapture<br />
how much was spent. Indeed, as Individuals, when we invest in securities, our first concern about mutual funds is always about the time frame during which we can get back our invested capital. So, it as simple and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<p>1. Payback period is straightforward to calculate and easy to understand, making it accessible for individuals without extensive financial knowledge.<br />
2. Liquidity Focus: It emphasizes the recovery of the initial investment, which is beneficial for businesses with cash flow constraints.<br />
3. Risk Assessment: A shorter payback period is generally seen as less risky since the investment recovers its cost more quickly.</p>
<p>Disadvantages:<br />
1. Payback period does not consider the time value of money, meaning it doesn&#8217;t account for the fact that a dollar received in the future is worth less than a dollar received today.<br />
2. It doesn&#8217;t provide insight into the profitability of an investment beyond the payback period. It ignores the cash flows that occur after the payback period.<br />
3. There is often subjectivity in determining an acceptable payback period. Different stakeholders may have different views on what is an appropriate time frame.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Suppose you have been assigned to develop online voting system. List four risks that might affect the success of the system. Rank the risks based on Risk exposure. Develop contingency plan for the highest ranked risk.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Developing an online voting system is a complex task that involves various risks.<br />
Here are four significant risks, ranked based on their risk exposure from highest to lowest:</p>
<p>1. Security Breaches (Highest Risk Exposure): The risk of hacking, unauthorized access, or manipulation of voting data. This is the most critical risk because it directly impacts the integrity and accuracy of the election results.<br />
2. System Failures: Risks related to technical malfunctions, such as server crashes, software bugs, or connectivity issues. These issues can disrupt the voting process.<br />
3. User Authentication Issues: Risks associated with verifying the identity of voters. Lack of proper authentication can lead to unauthorized voting or voter fraud.<br />
4. Legal and Compliance Challenges: Risks related to following the legal standards and regulatory requirements, which might include data protection laws and election regulations.</p>
<p>Contingency Plan for Security Breaches<br />
1. Preventive Measures:<br />
&#8211; Implement advanced security protocols like end-to-end encryption and multi-factor authentication.<br />
&#8211; Regularly update and patch the voting system to address security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>2. Detection and Monitoring: Establish real-time monitoring for any unusual activities or intrusion attempts.</p>
<p>3. Response Plan:<br />
&#8211; In case of a breach, immediately isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.<br />
&#8211; Have a dedicated response team ready to address the breach.<br />
&#8211; Notify relevant authorities and stakeholders about the incident in compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>4. Recovery and Post-Incident Analysis:<br />
&#8211; Implement backup systems to restore lost data.<br />
&#8211; Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to understand the breach&#8217;s cause and impact.<br />
&#8211; Revise and update security measures based on the insights gained from the incident.</p>
<p>5. Transparency and Communication:<br />
&#8211; Maintain clear and open communication with voters and stakeholders about the measures taken to ensure security.<br />
&#8211; Be transparent about any incidents and the steps being taken to resolve them. This contingency plan should be regularly reviewed and updated to adapt to evolving cyber threats and technological advancements.</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>Differentiate between activity-based approach and hybrid-based approach for identifying activities.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>These are 2 of the 3 most common approaches or methods for the identification of activities in any software project: Activity based approach, product based approach and hybrid-based approach.</p>
<p>Activity based approach:<br />
&#8211; It consists of creating a list of all the activities that the project is supposed to involve in its life cycle.<br />
&#8211; It can be done by using a brainstorming process which includes the complete project team and analyzing of the past projects. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is created for the same purpose.<br />
&#8211; It involves dividing a complex and big scale project into simpler, manageable, independent and smaller tasks which can be completed in approximately few weeks by a single development team working on the project.<br />
&#8211; The root of the project tree is labelled by the project name itself. Each node (activity) is recursively decomposed and divided into smaller sub-activities, until at the leaf level, the activities require approximately two weeks to develop and can be given to a single development team. It follows top-down approach.</p>
<p>Hybrid based approach:<br />
&#8211; It is the combination of both activity based approach and product based approach.<br />
&#8211; In this approach, an alternative work breakdown structure is constructed based on a simple list of final deliverable and for each deliverable, a set of activities required to produce that product.<br />
&#8211; It is more flexible, allowing for iterative development and adaptation to changes in project requirements or goals.<br />
&#8211; Ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve or are not<br />
fully known.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>Why software project management is a challenging activity?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>SPM is a challenging activity due to following reasons:<br />
&#8211; Unclear and undefined expectations: Defining goals is crucial for a successful project. Sometimes the project managers might fail to gather requirements clearly from the clients, which complicates the progress.<br />
&#8211; Time constraint: “Less time, more work.” is typical in the software development process. But what makes this a common challenge is the unrealistic deadlines from the clients sometimes, which leads to a race against time. As a result, it affects the quality of the software<br />
&#8211; Changing project requirements and priorities : One of the common challenges in software project management is changing requirements and priorities. The needs of the clients may change as the project progresses. And when that happens, extra time, cost, and resources need to be allocated, which further impacts the project.<br />
&#8211; Poor communication : Poor communication with clients, other stakeholders, and the development team affects the overall project. Miscommunication with clients will prevent getting the requirements. It will create conflicts within the team. If members don’t communicate with each other, then the roles and responsibilities will overlap with each other.<br />
&#8211; Changing technologies: The IT industry is one of the fastest-growing industries. So, rapid change in technologies isn’t a new thing. Today’s technology may not work tomorrow.<br />
&#8211; Quality testing: Meeting quality is another challenge for project managers. Bugs and errors are part of the development process. It is almost impossible not to get issues when developing software.<br />
&#8211; Managing risks: Sometimes, the project may not go smoothly as expected. Sometimes, there might be the risk of lack of resources, time, budget, etc. Other times, changes in the technology and market can affect the project.</p>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a theory of psychology explaining human motivation based on the pursuit of different levels of needs. The theory states that humans are motivated to fulfil their needs in a hierarchical order. This order begins with the most basic needs before moving on to more advanced needs. The ultimate goal, according to this theory, is to reach the fifth level of the hierarchy: self-actualization. There are five main levels to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-29078" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-12-130510.png?resize=528%2C269&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="528" height="269"></p>
<p>Physiological Needs: They are the lowest level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. They are the most essential things a person needs to survive. They include the need for shelter, water, food, warmth, rest, and health. A person’s motivation at this level derives from their instinct to survive.<br />
Safety Needs: Safety, or security needs, relate to a person’s need to feel safe and secure in their life and surroundings. Motivation comes from the need for law, order, and protection from unpredictable and dangerous conditions.<br />
Love and Belonging Needs: Humans are social creatures that crave interaction with others. This level of the hierarchy outlines the need for friendship, intimacy, family, and love. Humans have the need to give and receive love, to feel like they belong in a group. When deprived of these needs, individuals may experience loneliness or depression.<br />
Esteem Needs: Esteem needs are related to a person’s need to gain recognition, status, and feel respected. Once someone has fulfilled their love and belonging needs, they seek to fulfil their esteem needs. Maslow broke up esteem needs into two categories: the need for respect from others and the need for respect from oneself. Respect from others relates to achieving fame, prestige, and recognition. Respect from oneself relates to dignity, confidence, competence, independence, and freedom.<br />
Self-Actualization Needs: Self-actualization relates to the realization of an individual’s full potential. At this level, people strive to become the best that they possibly can be. The need for self-actualization can manifest in different ways, such as: Obtaining skills (e.g., financial modelling skills), Continued education (e.g., online training courses), Utilizing skills, knowledge, and talents, Pursuing life dreams, Seeking happiness, etc.</p>

<p>The basic configuration of SCM involves following steps:</p>
<p>i. Identify configuration items: Identify configuration items such as source code, documentation, requirements, design etc.</p>
<p>ii. Define the repository structure: This may include creating a folder structure that reflects the organization of software artifac.</p>
<p>iii. Choose a version control system: Choose any version control system from popular ones like Git.</p>
<p>iv. Establish a baseline: Establish a baseline or a starting point of the software development process.</p>
<p>v. Create a change management process: It outlines the procedures for making changes to the configuration items.</p>
<p>vi. Setup build and release management: It involve building the software and releasing it to users.</p>
<p>vii. Define access control and security: This may involve defining user roles and permissions, establishing password policies, procedures for granting access etc.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>Differentiate between Gantt chart and slip chart.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Gantt chart &#8211; It is used for tracking project progress .It is the simple and the oldest form of representing the progress of the project. It consists of activity bar that indicates the scheduled activity dates and the duration along with the activity floats. The chart identifies tasks may be executed in parallel and those that can&#8217;t be started or finished until others are complete. It can help detect potential bottlenecks and identify tasks that may have been excluded from the project&#8217;s timeline.<br />
Slip chart &#8211; It is the visual indication of activities that are not progressing to schedule. It is an alternative view of Gantt chart by providing a visual indication of those activities which are not on schedule. The more bend in the slip chart, greater the variation in the project plan. If the slip line deviates more towards the non achievement of project objectives then it has to be reconsidered. It is simply a chart of a product&#8217;s schedule slips, connecting points made by the pair of a ship date and the date it was announced. For example, on Day 0, the project you announce you will ship in 90 days. On day 90 you ship. Your slip chart consists of points (0,90) and (90,90). That is, you finished exactly when you said you would up front, and your graph is a horizontal line.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>Short Notes</p>
<p>1. Present worth</p>
<p>2. PERT diagram</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>1. Present worth<br />
Present Worth, or Present Value, is a financial metric that represents the current value of a series of future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money. The time value of money concept says that a certain amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential. To calculate the present worth, you typically discount future cash flows to their equivalent value in today&#8217;s dollars using a discount rate. The formula for present worth is:<br />
PW = FV/ {(1+r) ^n}<br />
Where:<br />
-PW is the present worth or present value,<br />
&#8211; FV is the future value or future cash flow,<br />
&#8211; r is the discount rate, and<br />
&#8211; nis the number of time periods.</p>
<p>2. PERT diagram<br />
A PERT chart, also known as a PERT diagram, is a tool used to schedule, organize, and map out tasks within a project. PERT stands for program evaluation and review technique. It provides a visual representation of a project&#8217;s timeline and breaks down individual tasks. These charts are similar to Gantt charts, but structured differently. This diagram consists of a few steps to get you from a project start date to end date. The PERT chart uses nodes &#8212; drawn as rectangles or circles &#8212; to represent events and milestones throughout the project. The nodes are connected by vectors &#8212; drawn as lines &#8212; which represent the various tasks that need to be completed.</p>
<p>When creating a PERT chart, project managers should follow the below steps:<br />
&#8211; Define all activities involved in the project.<br />
&#8211; Consider any dependencies between tasks.<br />
&#8211; Draw nodes and arrows based on the information gathered in the first two steps.<br />
&#8211; Identify the completion time for each task.</p>
