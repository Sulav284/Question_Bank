<p>The intentional change in goal after realization of previous goal is known as goal succession. E.g. a team is assigned to manufacture a cheapest car in the world. Once the car is manufactured as expected, the same team is assigned to manufacture the world most fuel efﬁcient car.

Under conditions of uncertainty, little is known about the alternatives or their outcomes. This situation arises when the level of ambiguity is higher at the time of making decisions.</p>

<h3>Question 10</h3>
<div><p><p>Describe the hierarchy of needs theory.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Need theory is based on the development of human needs. Abraham Maslow, a well-known psychologist, classified human needs into a hierarchical order in 1943. This hierarchy ranges from lower to higher needs, only after fulfilling the lower level needs is when higher needs are believed to emerge. In essence, Maslow believed that once higher-level needs are satisfied, new needs will emerge, motivating people further.Therefore, employees can be motivated to fulfill these new needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong>: Employees require a safe and conducive work environment, fair wages to afford basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and access to breaks for rest and refreshment. Employers need to ensure that these basic needs are met to support employee well-being.</li>
<li><strong>Safety Needs</strong>: Job security, a safe workplace, health benefits, and stable employment conditions are crucial. Employees seek assurance that their jobs are secure, that they won&#8217;t face undue risks at work, and that their basic needs won&#8217;t be threatened due to their employment situation.</li>
<li><strong>Belongingness and Social Needs</strong>: Teamwork, collaboration, and a positive work culture are essential for employees to feel a sense of belonging. Social interactions, supportive relationships with colleagues, and recognition within the workplace contribute to meeting these needs.</li>
<li><strong>Esteem Needs</strong>: Employees desire recognition for their contributions, opportunities for career advancement, feedback on their performance, and a sense of achievement. Respect, acknowledgement of their skills, and the ability to make meaningful contributions to the organization fulfill these needs.</li>
<li><strong>Self-Actualization Needs</strong>: This level involves opportunities for personal growth, creativity, autonomy, and the ability to realize one&#8217;s potential within the workplace. Employees strive for roles that allow them to use their full skill set, take on challenges, and find fulfillment in their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding and addressing these needs within the workplace can help employers create a conducive environment where employees feel valued, motivated, and engaged. Recognizing and supporting employees&#8217; needs at each level of the hierarchy can foster a more satisfied and productive workforce.</p>

Fulfilling organizational objectives hinges on the effectiveness of management practices.</p>
<p>In Nepali organizations, several common management practices prevail:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Planning Practice:</strong> In many Nepalese organizations, plans are made traditionally, often lacking SWOT or trend analysis. Relying on self-intuition makes plans less effective.</li>
<li><strong>Decision-Making Practice:</strong> Decisions are typically centralized without employee participation. The use of decision-making tools and scientific methods is minimal, resulting in less effective decisions and poor employee involvement in implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Organizing Practice:</strong> Organizational structures in Nepalese organizations tend to be complex and conflicting. They often follow a vertical structure and lack adaptation to matrix organization structures.</li>
<li><strong>Human Resource Management Practice:</strong> Government organizations in Nepal often face political influence in HR practices, impacting career development. In private organizations, priority is often given to family members, neglecting quality. The absence of fair job evaluation and reward systems discourages dedicated employees.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Practice:</strong> Central leadership styles are prevalent, hindering employee participation in decision-making and fostering conflict. Autocratic leadership leads to high turnover rates among skilled employees as they feel unrecognized and unsupported. There is a lack of two-way communication and collaborative efforts towards goal accomplishment in management leadership.</li>
