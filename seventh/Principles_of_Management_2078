    <h2>Group A: Answer any THREE questions</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>Define organizational goals. How are organizational goals formulated?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><h3>Organizational Goals</h3>
<p>Organizational goals are the expected outcomes from the activities performed within an organization. They represent the reasons for the organization&#8217;s existence and provide a desired destination that the organization aims to reach. Goals give the organization direction, helping focus activities toward achieving specific objectives. They are integral in guiding decision-making processes and ensuring that efforts are aligned with the organization&#8217;s overall mission.</p>
<h3>Approaches to Goal Formulation</h3>
<p>There are three main approaches to goal formulation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Top-Down Approach</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>top-down approach</strong> is directive in nature. In this method, top executives first develop the corporate goals, which are then disseminated to middle and lower-level managers for implementation. Top-level managers rely on their knowledge and experience to formulate these goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bottom-Up Approach</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>bottom-up approach</strong> is participatory. In this approach, functional workers at lower levels formulate goals for their specific positions and then pass them to top-level management for final revision and approval. Top management finalizes the goals based on the organization&#8217;s mission statement and then disseminates them for implementation at lower levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Management by Objectives (MBO)</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>MBO</strong>, proposed by Peter Drucker in 1960, involves both top-level and lower-level management jointly formulating organizational goals. This approach focuses on determining each individual&#8217;s major area of responsibility in terms of goals, giving employees a sense of ownership and motivating them. The collaborative effort between managers and subordinates in the goal-setting process is the major advantage of MBO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Goal Formation Process</h3>
<p>The process of goal formulation typically involves several key steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Assigning a Group</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Initially, a group is formed, involving managers from all levels (top, middle, and lower). The involvement of higher-level managers ensures the utilization of their expertise regarding environmental changes and resource allocation. Meanwhile, the participation of lower-level managers ensures that the goals are realistic, achievable, and that there is commitment towards their accomplishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Scanning</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The next step involves gathering and analyzing relevant information about the internal and external environment. This helps to identify political, technological, and socio-cultural changes and understand their possible impacts on the organization. It also includes assessing the organization’s strengths and weaknesses, which can help capitalize on opportunities and address potential threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Determining and Listing Potential Goals</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After analyzing the environmental factors, potential goals are formulated and listed. These goals should align with the organization’s mission and the opportunities identified in the environmental scan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming on Potential Goals</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Once the potential goals are identified, it is necessary to carefully evaluate each goal. Managers engage in discussions to assess the relevance, strengths, weaknesses, and future success potential of each goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reaching a Consensus</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After thoughtful discussion, the best goal from the list is chosen. There must be a consensus among the majority regarding the goal selection. This helps avoid conflicts and ensures motivation among workers to achieve the chosen goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Determining the Major Areas of Responsibility</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After finalizing the goal, managers determine the specific activities required to achieve it. Additionally, the authority-responsibility relationship for each activity is outlined, and tasks are assigned to individuals based on their areas of responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>State and explain the emerging challenges faced by managers while managing organizations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Managers face various challenges while managing organzations in today&#8217;s world. They are explained below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Globalization of business:</strong></p>
<p>Globalization means ﬂow of goods, services, informations, manpower etc across nations without any restrictions. Due to globalization, world is consider as the small village. The time and the place gap have been almost overcome by the help of new technologies. There is continuous exchange of new ideas, innovations, methods and techniques across nations.This bring both opportunities and threat to the business organization. A part from this, the regional agreement and World Trade Organization (WTO) boost up the competitive market and added more complexity to the manager&#8217;s job. Thus, managers need to understand the process of globalization and thethe competioncompetition ittectcreates for them and should act effectively and efﬁciently to overcome such challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
<p>Technology is a major drive that changes the way the people think and act in their corresponding environment. Technological advancement in computers and other electronic data processing equipment have changed the whole system of managerial functions like planning, decision making, organizing, motivating, controlling. Thus, managers need to recognize and anticipate technological change and act according to capitalize the opportunities and neutralize the threats.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Assurance and Productivity:</strong></p>
<p>In today&#8217;s context, quality is considered as the ability to satisfy the customer. However, the human wants are every growing and providing the goods and service to satisfy their needs is bigger challenge for a today&#8217;s manager. The product and services must meet the expectation of customer in terms cost, time, and services delivered within the product. To improve the quality Total Quality Management (TQM) is being used in most organizations targeting continuous programs that include of all the stakeholders together with suppliers and customers. A part from this productivity is also becoming a major issue for today&#8217;s organization. Due to extreme competition managers are focusing in reducing the wastages in terms of materials, time and effort and thus enhancing the productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Delegating the power to the employees is a major challenge to mangers in today&#8217;s context. People desire autonomy in their worksites. However, ineffective handling of such delegation may de-motivate the employees and leads to employee turnover, and other problems in work. Thus managers should create self-managed teams or autonomous work groups to empower the employees.</p>
<p><strong>Work-Force Diversity:</strong> It refers to the mix of people from various backgrounds in terms of gender, race, ethnicity etc in today&#8217;s labour force. The participation of women and minorities has been increasing. Thus, the challenge for a manager is to accommodate these diverse groups of people by addressing different lifestyles, family needs and work styles.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Organization:</strong> Organization must be able to learn from the past and present scenario and formulate policies and practices accordingly. Learning organization is one that had developed the capacity to continuously learn, adapt and change. The challenge for the managers is to change their behavioral style and transform from the bosses to the team leaders.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What is business environment? Explain the components of an organization’s internal environment.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Business environment is sum total of all forces surrounding and influencing the life and development of an organization. The business environment refers to the external and internal factors that influence a company&#8217;s operations and decision-making. External factors include economic conditions, competition, technology, and government regulations, while internal factors include company culture, management style, and financial resources.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>i) Internal Environment:</strong> Internal Environment is deﬁned as all the forces and conditions within an organization that inﬂuence organizational behavior. An organization&#8217;s internal environment has the following components:</p>
<p><strong>i) Employees:</strong> They are the main components and important assets of an organization. Employees are responsible to work as per the direction, goals, rule and regulation of the company. To work on these goals and directions, organization has to motivate and satisfy employees with speciﬁc reward policy.</p>

</div>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>Describe the different approaches to organizing.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Organizing refers to the process of arranging and structuring the resources of an organization to achieve its goals. This function involves determining how tasks and responsibilities are distributed, how departments are designed, and how information flows within the organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.Classical Approach:</strong></p>
<p>F.W. Taylor, Henry Fayol, and Max Weber, were major contributors to the classic approach to organizational design. Though, their prescriptions and approaches to organizing are different, they all advocate &#8220;universal principles&#8221; of organizing. They attempt to specify the &#8220;one best way&#8221; to organizing.</p>
<p>==&gt; F. W. Taylor believed that the key to organizing is to scientiﬁcally design the job. Taylor&#8217;s ideas on organizing are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Scientiﬁc approach to work by determining optimal workload laid by breaking</p>
<p>down the job into smaller components.</p>
<p>b. Incentive for reward by designing incentive system in which the workers receive more pay for more output.</p>
<p>c. Separation of planning from performance by dividing work between management and workers.</p>
<p>==&gt; Max Weber is remembered for his work on bureaucracy. The bureaucratic organization has to the following components:</p>
<p>a. Hierarchy: Jobs are highly specialized and arranged in a hierarchy.</p>
<p>b. Rules and regulations: All tasks are performed according to predetermined rules</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>procedures.</p>
<p>c. Authority levels: Employees exercise authority in performing their jobs.</p>
<p>d. Impersonality: Impersonality in performing the task is extremely important.</p>
<p>e. Technical qualiﬁcation and career orientation: Employment and promotion are based on technical qualiﬁcation and achievement. Therefore, seniority is the main</p>
<p>factor in promotion.</p>
<p>==&gt; Similarly, Henry Fayol main principles of organizing are:</p>
<p>a. Unity of command</p>
<p>b. Scalar chain</p>
<p>c. Authority and responsibility</p>
<p>d. Unity of Direction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.Behavioral Approach: </strong></p>
<p>Behavioral approach to organizing focuses on</p>
<p>employee behavior. It points out the people deserve to be the central focus of any organized activity. The following persons are the major contributors in the development of behavioral approach:</p>
<p>a. Elton Mayo&#8217;s human relations approach highlighted the&#8221; people side&#8221; of an organization His studies found that the social context of work, including group norms and interpersonal relation is very important for organizing work activities.</p>
<p>b. The researchers at the Tavistock Institute of Technology in England developed the sociotechnical systems approach. Similarly, John Woodward developed the task-technology approach. These approaches explain the consequences of different types of technical and organizational forms for job satisfaction and workgroup behavior.</p>
<p>c. Chris Argyris propose the Personality and Organization Theory. He argued that each individual has some potential, which can be realized give the right environment. He suggested that to achieve a balance between structures and people&#8217;s needs, there should be ﬂexible roles, open communication, and reliance on self-direction.</p>
<p>d. David McClelland, Fred Fiedler, and Frederic Herzberg provided manger with still greater insights into employee behavior through their motivation and leadership theories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.Contingency Approach: </strong></p>
<p>Systems and contingency approaches have some common viewpoints on organizing. The contingency approach to organizing is logical. Organizations obviously differ in size, objective, and environmental uncertainty. Similarly, employees of these organizations differ in values, attitudes, needs, and experiences. So it is not wise to talk about universally applicable approaches that work in all situations. The Following variables are mainly considered by the contingency approach:</p>
<p><strong>a. Technology:</strong> Technology is important to all types of organizations. It is a means by which raw material are transferred into outputs. Selection of technology and its best use are the deciding factors for effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>b. Environment:</strong> Environment has inﬂuence on organization&#8217;s structure and performance. In fact, environmental factors determine the structure.</p>
<p><strong>c. Size:</strong> Size affects organizational designs in very complex ways. Large organizations have complex structures. The smaller ones have more ﬂexible structures.</p>

<h2>Group B: Answer any TEN questions</h2><h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the different skills required for managers.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>To successfully lead a team and become a respected manager you&#8217;ll need a a a speci specific ﬁc set of skills. Some of the skills required for managers are given below: of the skills required for are given below:</p>
<p>1. Technical skill is knowledge of and proﬁciency in activities involving methods, processes, and procedures. Thus it involves working with tools and speciﬁc techniques. For example, mechanics work with tools, and their supervisors should have the ability to teach them how to use these tools. Similarly, accountants apply speciﬁc techniques in doing their job.</p>
<p>2. Human skill is the ability to work with people; it is cooperative effort; it is teamwork; it is the creation of an environment in which people feel secure and free to express their opinions.</p>
<p>3. Conceptual skill is the ability to see the &#8220;big picture,&#8221; to recognize signiﬁcant elements in a situation, and to understand the relationships among the elements.</p>
<p>4. Design skill is the ability to solve problems in ways that will beneﬁt the enterprise. To be effective, particularly at upper organizational levels, managers</p>
<p>must be able to do more than see a problem. If managers merely see the problem and become &#8220;problem watchers,&#8221; they will fail.</p>
<p>5. Emotional Intelligence: Knowing one&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses, as well as understanding how one&#8217;s actions impact others, is is vital for for a a manager.Recognizing and understanding the emotions of of others helps build strong relationships and fosters a positive work environment.</p>
