<h4>Guided transmission media:</h4>
<p>Guided transmission media consists of physical connection between source and destination through a wire or a cable.</p>
<p>There are three basic types of guided media which are as follows −</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Twisted pair cable</li>
<li>Co-axial cable</li>
<li>Fiber-optic cable</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Twisted Pair Cable:</strong></span></p>
<p>Twisted-Pair Cable consists of two insulated conductors wire wound (normally copper), twisted together. In which one wire is to carry the signal to destination and other is used as a ground reference. Twisting is done so that the noise will equally affect the wire from the external environment.</p>
<p class="conh"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span id="advantage-of-twisted-pair-cable">Advantage:</span></span></em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>The frequency range is 0 to 3.5 kHz</li>
<li>Repeater spacing is 2 KM</li>
</ol>
<p class="conh"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span id="disadvantage-of-twisted-pair-cable">Disadvantage:</span></span></em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>No capacity to carrying a signal over long distances without the use of repeaters.</li>
<li>Not suitable for broadband applications because of low bandwidth capacity.</li>
<li>Poor security and easy to tap.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Co-axial cable:</strong></span></p>
<p>Coaxial cable has a central core conductor of stranded or solid wire (usually copper) enclosed in an insulating protection cover, which is, in turn, encased in an outer conductor of metal foil or a combination of the two. The outer metallic work as a shield against noise and as a conductor, which complete the circuit. The whole cable is covered by a plastic cover.</p>
<p class="conh1"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Types:</span></em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>BaseBand</strong>: (50 ohms) used for digital transmission.</li>
<li><strong>BroadBand</strong>: uses for analog transmission on standard TV cable.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantage:</span></em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Carries signals of higher data rate and bandwidth.</li>
<li>Used in analog telephone networks and traditional Cable TV networks.</li>
</ol>
<p class="conh"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantage:</span></em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>The network depends on a single cable.</li>
<li>Expensive and difficult to install when compared with twisted pair.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3. Fiber Optic Cable:</strong></span></p>
<p>Fiber-Optic Cable is made of glass and transmits of data is based on the concept of reflection of light through glass. A glass core is surrounded by less dense glass called cladding.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advantage:</span></em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Noise resistance</li>
<li>Less signal attenuation</li>
<li>Higher bandwidth</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disadvantage:</span></em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>They are very expensive</li>
<li>hard to install and maintained</li>
<li>Fragility (easily broken)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What is flow control? Explain Stop-and-Wait ARQ with suitable example. How is it different from G-Back-N ARQ?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Flow control is a technique that allows two stations working at different speeds to communicate with each other. It is a set of measures taken to regulate the amount of data that a sender sends so that a fast sender does not overwhelm a slow receiver. In data link layer, flow control restricts the number of frames the sender can send before it waits for an acknowledgment from the receiver.</p>
<p>Two method have been developed to control the follow of data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Stop and Wait</li>
<li>Sliding Window</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Stop-and-wait ARQ:</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Characteristics:</span></em></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Used in Connection-oriented communication.</li>
<li>It offers error and flows control</li>
<li>It is used in Data Link and Transport Layers</li>
<li>Stop and Wait for ARQ mainly implements the Sliding Window Protocol concept with Window Size 1</li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Working:</span></em></p>
<p>1) Sender A sends a data frame or packet with sequence number 0.<br />
2) Receiver B, after receiving the data frame, sends an acknowledgement with sequence number 1 (the sequence number of the next expected data frame or packet)<br />
There is only a one-bit sequence number that implies that both sender and receiver have a buffer for one frame or packet only.</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-6727 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-7.png?resize=470%2C488&#038;ssl=1" alt="Stop and Wait ARQ" width="470" height="488" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-7.png?w=842&amp;ssl=1 842w, https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stop-and-Wait-ARQ-7.png?resize=768%2C796&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" /></p>
<p>The Stop and Wait ARQ solves the problems but may cause big performance issues as the sender always waits for acknowledgement even if it has the next packet ready to send. Consider a situation where you have a high bandwidth connection and propagation delay is also high (you are connected to some server in some other country through a high-speed connection). To solve this problem, we can send more than one packet at a time with a larger sequence number.</p>
<p>So Stop and Wait ARQ may work fine where propagation delay is very less for example LAN connections but performs badly for distant connections like satellite connections.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain link state routing with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Link state routing is a technique in which each router shares the knowledge of its neighborhood with every other router in the internetwork.</p>
<h4 class="h2">Link State Routing has two phases:</h4>
<p class="h3"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Reliable Flooding</span></strong></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>Initial state:</strong> Each node knows the cost of its neighbors.</li>
<li><strong>Final state:</strong> Each node knows the entire graph.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h3"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Route Calculation</strong></span></p>
<p>Each node uses Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm on the graph to calculate the optimal routes to all nodes.</p>
<ul class="points">
<li>The Link state routing algorithm is also known as Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm which is used to find the shortest path from one node to every other node in the network.</li>
<li>The Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm is an iterative, and it has the property that after k<sup>th</sup> iteration of the algorithm, the least cost paths are well known for k destination nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#8217;s understand through an example:</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notaions:</span></em></p>
<ul class="points">
<li><strong>D(v):</strong> It defines the cost of the path from source code to destination v that has the least cost currently.</li>
<li><strong>P(v):</strong> It defines the previous node (neighbor of v) along with current least cost path from source to v.</li>
<li><strong>N:</strong> It is the total number of nodes available in the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above example, Source Vertex is A</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>The first step is an initialization step. The currently known least cost path from A to its directly attached neighbors, B, C, D are 2,5,1 respectively. The cost from A to B is set to 2, from A to D is set to 1 and from A to C is set to 5. The cost from A to E and F are set to infinity as they are not directly linked to A.</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>What is CSMA/CD? Why is there no need for CSMA/CD on a full-duplex Ethernet LAN?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a network protocol for carrier transmission that operates in the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. It senses or listens whether the shared channel for transmission is busy or not, and defers transmissions until the channel is free. The collision detection technology detects collisions by sensing transmissions from other stations. On detection of a collision, the station stops transmitting, sends a jam signal, and then waits for a random time interval before retransmission.</p>
<p>There is no need for CSMA/CD on a full-duplex Ethernet LAN because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>For a full duplex transmission the chance for collision as well as contention is less compared to half duplex.</li>
<li>Everyone can send and recieve datas independantly.</li>
<li>so there is no chance for carrier sensing and collision detection.</li>
<li>it makes no need for CSMA/CD on a full-duplex Ethernet LAN.</li>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><p>What is virtual circuit network? Explain ATM as a virtual circuit wide area network.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A virtual circuit network is a category of the packet switching network, where a virtual path is established between the source and the destination systems for data communication to occur. This path appears to the user as if it is a dedicated physical path, but actually is a logical circuit allocated from a managed pool of circuit resources as per traffic requirements. The network resources forming parts of this path can be shared by other communications, however, is not visible to this user.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2nd Part:</strong></span></p>
<p>ATM also known as cell relay, is a streamlined packet transfer interface that takes advantage of the reliability and fidelity of modern digital facilities to provide faster packet switching than x2. Like packet switching and frame relay, ATM involves the transfer of data in discrete chunks and allows multiple logical connections to be multiplexed over a single physical interface.</p>
<p>In the case of ATM, the information flow on each logical connection is organized into fixed-size packets called cells. It is a streamlined protocol with minimal error and flows control capabilities. This reduces the overhead of processing ATM cells and reduces the number of overhead bits required with each cell, enabling ATMs to operate at high data rates.</p>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>What is routing table? Differentiate static routing table with dynamic roting table.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A routing table is a set of rules, often viewed in a table format, that is used to determine where data packets traveling over an Internet Protocol (IP) network will be directed. All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, use routing tables.</p>
<p>See below a Routing Table:</p>
<pre> <b>Destination</b>      <b>Subnet mask</b>         <b>Interface</b>
 128.75.43.0      255.255.255.0       Eth0
 128.75.43.0      255.255.255.128     Eth1
 192.12.17.5      255.255.255.255     Eth3
 default                              Eth2</pre>
<p>The entry corresponding to the <i>default</i> gateway configuration is a network destination of 0.0.0.0 with a network mask (net mask) of 0.0.0.0. The Subnet Mask of the default route is always 255.255.255.255.</p>

<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the different approaches for multimedia streaming? Explain.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Streaming media is video or audio content sent in compressed form over the internet and played immediately over a user&#8217;s device, rather than being saved to the device&#8217;s hard drive or solid-state drive.</p>
<p>During the streaming process, the media file that&#8217;s played on the user&#8217;s device is retrieved from a remote location and transmitted continuously over the internet using a wired or wireless connection.</p>
<p>With streaming media, a user does not have to download an entire audio or video file to play it. Instead, the file is sent in a continuous stream of data to the user&#8217;s device so it can play as it arrives in real-time or near real-time. The user can also pause, rewind or fast-forward the file, just as they could with a downloaded file unless the content is being streamed life, in which case the user can only watch or possibly participate in the event.</p>
<p>Streaming files &#8212; audio, video, and others &#8212; are stored on a server somewhere on the World Wide Web (WWW). When a user requests the file, it gets transmitted over the web as sequential packets of data that are streamed instantly. Since streaming data is broken down into data packets, its transmission is similar to that of other types of data sent over the internet.</p>
<p>The file is played within a browser on the client&#8217;s device. An audio or video player hosted by the browser accepts the flow of data packets from the streaming service&#8217;s remote server and interprets them as video or audio, then plays the media for the user. Unlike traditional media systems where files are downloaded and stored on the device, streaming media files are deleted automatically once the user ends the streaming.</p>
<p>Some streaming services rely on User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to stream their content, while others use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Both UDP and TCP are transport protocols used to move data packets across networks. TCP opens a dedicated connection before transmitting data, which makes it a more reliable protocol than UDP. However, TCP also takes longer to transmit data compared to UDP. TCP and UDP are both used with the Internet Protocol (IP).</p>
<p>Most streaming services use content delivery networks (CDNs) to store content in locations that are closer to users. Such proximity reduces streaming latency, speeds up content delivery, and reduces buffering.</p>

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>Write short note on (any two):</p>
<ol>
<li>Blackbone network</li>
<li>ISDN</li>
<li>ALOHA</li>
</ol</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blackbone network:</strong></span></p>
<p>A <b>backbone network</b> is a network containing a high-capacity connectivity infrastructure that forms the main link, or backbone, to the different parts of the network. The network consists of various LANs, WANs, and subnetworks. The connectivity may cover a local area within a building or vicinity or may have a global outreach that spans vast geographical areas. The backbone has a capacity that far exceeds that of the individual networks connected to it.</p>
<p>A backbone network normally consists of cabling, switches, bridges, routers, and gateways in varying segments. Individual nodes do not connect directly to the backbone but do so through their LANs and ISPs or larger organizational infrastructures.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ISDN:</strong></span></p>
<p>ISDN is a circuit-switched telephone network system, but it also provides access to packet-switched networks that allows digital transmission of voice and data. This results in potentially better voice or data quality than an analog phone can provide. It provides a packet-switched connection for data in increments of 64 kilobit/s. It provided a maximum of 128 kbit/s bandwidth in both upstream and downstream directions. A greater data rate was achieved through channel bonding. Generally, ISDN B channels of three or four BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ISDN Interfaces: </span></p>
<p>The following are the interfaces of ISDN:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Basic Rate Interface (BRI):</li>
<li>Primary Rate Interface(PRI):</li>
<li>Broadband-ISDN</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ALOHA:</strong></span></p>
<p>The Aloha Protocol allows several stations to send data frames over the same communication channel at the same time. This protocol is a straightforward communication method in which each network station is given equal priority and works independently.</p>
<p>Aloha is a medium access control (MAC) protocol for the transmission of data via a shared network channel. Using this protocol, several data streams originating from multiple nodes are transferred through a multi-point transmission channel.</p>
<p>There are two types of Aloha protocols − Pure Aloha and Slotted Aloha.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>In Pure Aloha, the time of transmission is continuous. Whenever a station has an available frame, it sends the frame. If there is a collision and the frame is destroyed, the sender waits for a random amount of time before retransmitting it.</li>
<li>In Slotted Aloha, time is divided into discrete intervals called slots, corresponding to a frame.</li>
</ul>
