    <h2>SECTION A: Attempt any TWO questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>What is a dual signature? Describe the dual signature operations? How is dual signature used during purchase request operation of SET protocol?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Digital signature</strong> is unique, just like a handwritten one, because the private key is only in the possession of one individual. It is a close parallel to a handwritten signature. When used with a hash function, the digital signature is even more unique than a handwritten signature. To ensure the authenticity of the message, and to ensure nonrepudiation, the sender encrypts the entire block of cipher text one or more time using sender’s private key. This produces a digital signature that can be sent over the internet.</p>
<p>In<strong> operation of dual signature</strong> private and public keys are generated by the involved parties, who are the merchant and the client. Using their respective private keys, the buyer and seller digitally sign their portions of the transaction. A single dual signature is created by fusing the signatures of the client and the merchant. This composite signature is then used to confirm the transaction&#8217;s integrity and legitimacy. It can be explained in steps as:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Key Generation</strong>: A public key and a private key are created by the sender and the recipient.</li>
<li><strong>Signing</strong>: The sender uses their private key to sign the communication. By doing this, a digital signature is produced that can only be validated with the public key of the sender.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Using the recipient&#8217;s public key, the sender encrypts the message. This guarantees that the communication can only be decrypted by the recipient.</li>
<li><strong>Transmission</strong>: The recipient receives the encrypted and signed message.</li>
<li><strong>Verification</strong>: The communication is decrypted by the recipient using their private key. Next, the recipient uses the sender&#8217;s public key to confirm the digital signature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol uses dual signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of purchase requests. The customer&#8217;s bank uses a dual signature to both sign and encrypt the purchase request. This ensures that the purchase request hasn&#8217;t been altered and that the merchant can verify the customer&#8217;s identity.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The dual signature guarantees that the Order Information (OI) and Payment Information (PI) are connected and unaltered.</li>
<li>It is used to authenticate and verify the identity of the merchant and customer.</li>
<li>It guarantees the confidentiality of the transaction information, as only the merchant and customer can decrypt the data.</li>
<li>The dual signature is used by the payment gateway to confirm the payment details.</li>
<li>It ensures that the transaction data is not altered during transmission.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What is digital marketing? Why is it essential in e-commerce? How do marketing metrics like click-through rate, bounce-back rate and conversion rate influence E-mail marketing?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Digital marketing</strong> is the component of marketing that utilizes internet and online based digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services. Digital marketing uses a range of strategies to reach customers, to convince customers to reach to products and services or convince them into making a purchase. Modern digital marketing comprises a broad system of channels including: Social media, Content marketing, Website marketing, SEO etc.</p>
<p>It is essential in e-commerce due to following reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Understanding the Audience</strong>: Aids in comprehending and successfully establishing a connection with the target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Compared to conventional marketing techniques, it provides an affordable means of reaching a big audience.</li>
<li><strong>Reach Worldwide</strong>: Enables companies to advertise their goods and services to everyone, anywhere in the globe.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Able to quickly adjust to shifting consumer preferences and market trends.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization</strong>: Gives companies the ability to tailor marketing messages to specific clients via social media, email, and search engines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Click-through Rate (CTR)</strong> measures how many people click on the links in your email. For example, if you send an email to 100 people and 10 click on the product link, your CTR is 10%. A higher CTR means that the email content is engaging, and people are interested in checking out your products. This drives traffic to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Bounce-back Rate</strong> refers to how many emails couldn’t be delivered. For example, if 5 out of 100 emails didn’t reach their inboxes, the bounce rate is 5%. A low bounce rate indicates that your email list is clean and accurate. If the rate is high, it could mean you have invalid or spammy email addresses in your list. This helps ensure your messages are reaching potential customers and verifies that your recipients are legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>Conversion Rate</strong> is the percentage of email recipients who complete a desired action, such as making a purchase. If 100 people open your email and 5 buy your product, the conversion rate is 5%. This metric shows how effectively your email is driving sales. If the conversion rate is low, adjustments may be needed to make the email more compelling. A higher conversion rate indicates that your email marketing is successful in turning engagement into actual sales.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What is B 2 B e-commerce? Discuss various B 2 B business models.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Business-to-business e-commerce</strong> is the procedure for locating and accepting terms for the purchase of products or services. It facilitates the purchase of a business. One of the most important aspects of procurement is getting the proper amount, quality, pricing, and delivery time.</p>
<p>Various B 2 B business models are:</p>
<p>1.<strong> Network Market Places:</strong> Network market places are the online market places where different business vendors can gather and do transaction.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>E-distributor:</strong> Companies that supply products and services directly to individual businesses are distributors. E-distributors are owned by one company seeking to serve many customers. With more products and services a company makes available on it&#8217;s site, the more attractive that site is to potential customers.</li>
<li><strong>E-Procurement:</strong> Procurement is the process of finding and agreeing to terms, and acquiring goods or services. It helps in buying to decide market value of the product or service being purchased by a company. Right price, timely delivery, right quality, right quantity, etc. are major components of procurement.</li>
<li><strong>Exchange market:</strong> An exchange market is an independent digital marketplace where hundreds of suppliers meet a smaller number of very large commercial purchasers. They focus on the exchange of direct inputs to production and short-term contracts or spot purchasing.</li>
<li><strong>Industry consortium:</strong> These are industry-owned vertical marketplaces that serve specific industries, such as the automobile, aerospace, chemical etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Private Industrial Networks:</strong> A private industrial network is a digital network designed to coordinate the flow of communications among firms engaged in business together. The network is owned by a single large purchasing firm. It constitutes about 75% of all B2B expenditures. For instance, Walmart operates one of the largest private industrial networks in the world for its suppliers, who on a daily basis use Walmart&#8217;s network to monitor the sales of their goods, the status of shipments, and the actual inventory level of their goods.</p>

<div><p><p>What does omni-channel mean in terms of e-commerce presence? Justify with an example</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Omnichannel e-commerce</strong> is a unified experience for customers across all digital devices and platforms. This strategy ensures that customers can interact with a brand seamlessly, whether they&#8217;re shopping on a website, through a mobile app, via social media, or in physical stores.</p>
<p><strong>For example :</strong><br />
A customer might start browsing for Goldstar shoes on the Daraz mobile app, then switch to the Goldstar website to explore more options, and finally visit a physical Goldstar store in Lagankhel to try them on.</p>
<p>With an omnichannel strategy, Goldstar can track the customer&#8217;s activity across these platforms, providing consistent product information, promotions, and recommendations, ensuring a smooth shopping experience at every touchpoint.</p>
<p>This approach helps Goldstar understand the customer journey better and create a more personalized experience, ultimately leading to higher customer engagement and more successful sales strategies.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>What is an e-payment system? How do online credit card transactions work?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Electronic payment system (EPS)</strong> is a way of paying for goods and services electronically instead of using direct cash or physical cheque. EPS simply means online transaction of values. Online Credit Card Transaction, Online Stored Value Payment System, Digital and Mobile Wallet, E-Checks, Virtual Currency etc. are some of the E-payment systems. New types of purchasing relationships, such as between individuals online and new technologies such as the development of the mobile platform, have created both a need and an opportunity for the development of new payment systems.</p>
<p><strong>Online credit card transactions</strong> are processed in much the same way that on-the-spot purchases with the major credit cards, but there are some notable differences. There being no inspection of documents, and the actual goods being purchased never even see the credit card, new types of purchases are also called Cardholder Not Present (CNP) transactions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-50504" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/online-credit-card-.drawio.png?resize=419%2C251&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="419" height="251"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>fig: Online credit card transactions</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>There are five parties involved, as are credit card purchases. Consumers, Merchants, Clearinghouse, Issuing Bank and Consumer’s bank.</li>
<li>There are credit card and Consumer’s bank, a messaging bank, Clearinghouse and processes begin with a purchase.</li>
<li>Consumers make a purchase online with the system to the merchant wanting to process.</li>
<li>As he enters the merchant’s tunnel, the credit card information is sent to the issuing bank through the internet.</li>
<li>Once the consumer submits, the credit card is validated. Then the merchant’s software sends to the clearinghouse by the nearest node. The issuing bank is to verify the received request.</li>
<li>The issuing bank credits the merchant’s account once validated, the issuing bank credits the merchant’s account (a money statement) account is consolidated to the consumer in the consumer statement.</li>

</div>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><p>How cryptography and hash functions are used in e-commerce to ensure security.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Cryptography is essential in order to protect sensitive data&#8217;s secrecy, integrity, and validity during e-commerce transactions.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Sensitive information is shielded from unwanted access during transmission by encryption methods such as symmetric key cryptography (AES) and asymmetric key cryptography (RSA, ECC), which convert it into unintelligible ciphertext.</li>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Data integrity is confirmed by hash algorithms such as SHA-256, which produce distinct &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; (hash values) for each piece of data. Any change made to the data will produce a new hash value, making manipulation instantly apparent.</li>
<li><strong>Non-repudiation</strong>: By combining hash functions and asymmetric cryptography, digital signatures enable parties to verify the legitimacy and provenance of a communication or document, avoiding rejection of acts committed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hash Functions in E-Commerce</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Storage of Passwords</strong>: In the event of a data breach, hiding plain-text passwords from prying eyes is prevented by hashing them before keeping them.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction validation</strong>: It is the process of hashing transactions to assure data integrity and that the transaction details have not been altered.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, safe e-commerce activities depend on cryptography and hash functions. They provide confidence and dependability in online transactions, preserve sensitive data, and protect user privacy.</p>

How is the SSL protocol used in e-commerce?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>&#8220;Advertising-supported software,&#8221; or &#8220;adware,&#8221; is a kind of software that downloads or shows adverts on a computer or mobile device automatically. It can be installed without the user&#8217;s express permission and is frequently included with free applications. It is designed to throw advertisements on our web browsers. Some security professionals view it as the PUP (potentially unwanted program).</p>
<p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was created to enable safe communication across a computer network; it has now been substantially superseded by Transport Layer Security (TLS). SSL/TLS is essential in the context of e-commerce for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Data Encryption</strong>: The information sent between a user&#8217;s browser and the e-commerce server is encrypted using SSL/TLS. This guarantees that bad actors cannot intercept sensitive data while it is being sent, including credit card numbers, personal information, and login credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: SSL/TLS offers a way to confirm that the people communicating are who they say they are. This makes it easier to verify that clients are engaging with trustworthy e-commerce websites rather than phony ones.</li>
<li><strong>Data Integrity</strong>: SSL/TLS guarantees that no changes were made to the data being delivered or received during transmission. Maintaining the precision and dependability of transactions depends on this.</li>
<li><strong>Trust indications</strong>: SSL/TLS-enabled websites frequently have trust indications, including &#8220;https://&#8221; in the URL or a padlock icon in the browser&#8217;s address bar. Customers&#8217; trust and confidence in the site&#8217;s security are increased by these signs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, SSL/TLS is crucial for safeguarding e-commerce transactions online, shielding the company and its clients from possible security risks.</p>

<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>Describe the working mechanism of search engines.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A search engine is a software accessible through a Web site that helps people find things on the Web. Search engines contain three major parts: Spider, Index, and Search utility.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Spider</strong>:<br />
It is a program that automatically searches the Web to find Web pages that might be interesting to people. When the spider finds Web pages, it collects the URL of the page and information contained in the page. This information might include the page&#8217;s title, keywords included in the pages, and information about other pages on the Web site. The keywords are enclosed in an HTML tag set called meta tags.</li>
<li><strong>Index</strong>:<br />
The store element of a search engine is called its index or database. The spider returns information to the index. The index checks to see if information about the Web page is already stored. If it is, it compares the stored information to the new information and determines whether to update the page information. The index is designed to allow fast searches of its very large amount of stored information.</li>
<li><strong>Search Utility</strong>:<br />
Search utility takes search items and finds entries for Web pages in its index that match those search terms. The Search utility program creates a Web page that has a list of links to URLs that the search engine has found in its index that match the site visitor&#8217;s search terms. The visitor can then click the links to visit those sites.</li>
</ul>
