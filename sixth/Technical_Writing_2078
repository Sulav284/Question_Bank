<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What should one keep in mind when writing for the web? Discuss.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A web page writing is a document, commonly written in HTML, that is viewed in an Internet browser. It is also called web page writing. A web page can be accessed by entering a URL address into a browser&#8217;s address bar. A web page may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files. Writing for the web involves two or more persons working together to produce a web-based document. One should have the following mentioned knowledge in mind when writing for the web:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Website Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Your website needs to accommodate the needs of the user. Having a simple clear intention on all pages will help the user interact with what you have to offer. What is the purpose of your website? Are you imparting practical information like a &#8216;How to guide&#8217;? Is it an entertainment website like sports coverage or are you selling a product to the user? There are many different purposes that websites may have but there are core purposes common to all websites;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Describing Expertise</li>
<li>Building Your Reputation</li>
<li>Generating Leads</li>
<li>Sales and Aftercare</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>Simplicity is the best way to go when considering the user experience and the usability of your website. Below are ways to achieve simplicity through design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>Color has the power to communicate messages and evoke emotional responses. Finding a color palette that fits your brand will allow you to influence your customer&#8217;s behavior toward your brand. Keep the color selection limited to less than 5 colors. Complementary colors work very well. Pleasing color combinations increase customer engagement and make the user feel good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Type</strong></p>
<p>Typography has an important role to play on your website. It commands attention and works as the visual interpretation of the brand&#8217;s voice. Typefaces should be legible and only use a maximum of 3 different fonts on the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Imagery</strong></p>
<p>Imagery is every visual aspect used within communications. This includes still photography, illustration, video, and all forms of graphics. All imagery should be expressive and capture the spirit of the company and act as the embodiment of the brand personality. Most of the initial information we consume on websites is visual and as a first impression, it is important that high-quality images are used to form an impression of professionalism and credibility in the visitor&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Navigation</strong></p>
<p>Navigation is the way-finding system used on websites where visitors interact and find what they are looking for. Website navigation is key to retaining visitors. If the navigation of the website is confusing, visitors will give up and find what they need elsewhere. Keeping navigation simple, intuitive, and consistent on every page is key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>F-Shaped Pattern Reading</strong></p>
<p>The F-based pattern is the most common way visitors scan text on a website. Eye-tracking studies have found that most of what people see is in the top and left areas of the screen. The F-shaped layout mimics our natural pattern of reading in the West (left to right and top to bottom). An effectively designed website will work with a reader&#8217;s natural pattern of scanning the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Visual Hierarchy</strong></p>
<p>Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements is order of importance. This is done either by size, color, imagery, contrast, typography, whitespace, texture, and style. One of the most important functions of visual hierarchy is to establish a focal point; this shows visitors where the most important information is.</p>

<h2>Section B: Attempt any eight questions.</h2><h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>What is a press release? What steps should one follow to produce an effective press release?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Press release is a short official document or report prepared on the basis of particular events or facts. It is also called a news release. The main purpose of the press release is to announce the message related to an event, product, service, or state of affairs. The press release may include launching a new product or service, announcing an employee promotion, a company expansion, and so on. Other examples may include the announcement of city council meetings, fundraising, and other public events. By the use of press release, people or organizations send news releases to the media to share information with the public. In many organizations, the communication between the company and the outside world is handled by press or news release. Such programs help to maintain public relations and maintain the positive image of the company. For example; if the executive of a company is involved in a scandal, the public relations staff may prepare news for the press release to present the views of the company and restore public confidence. The main purpose of the press release is to announce important and specific news regarding an event, product, service, or changed circumstances.</p>
<p>The steps one should follow while producing an effective press release are discussed as below.</p>
<p><strong>a. Head</strong><br />
It includes information regarding the organization, such as name, logo, address, and other necessary information along with a phrase called &#8220;Press Release&#8221;. The heading introduces the main agent of the press release.</p>
<p><strong>b. Dateline/ Release date</strong><br />
It refers to the date of the press release. The dateline is often mentioned in the first paragraph of the press release.</p>
<p><strong>c. Headline</strong><br />
Each press release must have an interesting headline. The catchy headline may attract the audience&#8217;s attention to know what the press release is about. The headline may appear at the top just below the phrase &#8216;press release&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>d. Opening Paragraph</strong><br />
This is the first body paragraph of the press release. It should answer the most important questions &#8216;Who What? When? Where? Why? and How?&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>e. Remaining Paragraphs</strong><br />
This part may include a number of paragraphs with the main theme or message of the release. The writer may also include images, graphics, and video clips related to the release. To maintain the credibility of the news, it is necessary to quote the level management and their authentic message. Do not forget to provide links for digital format press release.</p>
<p><strong>f. Boilerplate</strong><br />
This is the final paragraph of the press release. It provides background information about the organization. The boilerplate should be clear and precise enough to create a positive attitude of the audience toward the organization.</p>
<p><strong>g. End notation</strong><br />
It is the end of the press release. One can end with the notation of three hashes such as ###, if the release is of one page. For several pages, the notation such as &#8220;Continue. P.T.O. or More&#8230;&#8221; should be used to indicate the release continues until the final page. Finally, the contact information such as e-mail and phone number should be supplied along with the phrase &#8220;For more information, contact us&#8221;.</p>

<p>Everybody has something they love to do and focus on called a hobby. People have differences in hobbies. I prefer playing football with my friends.

The  Federation of International Football Association (FIFA), the international authority is the caretaker of football as a game worldwide. I have been learning to play football from my school life. My interest in football game started in class two when my young brain was hooked with a small round gifted ball during the world cup tournament. Since then I began to cultivate this game as my hobby. I played in many local-level tournaments and won several medals. Football is an interesting game. It has been a source of entertainment and freshness for both players and viewers.
