    <h2>Section A: Attempt any two questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>What is competitive advantage in a business model? How can firms achieve competitive advantage using dimensions of asymmetry, complementary resources, perfect market and leverage?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Competitive advantage</strong> in a business model refers to the unique strengths or attributes that enable a company to outperform its competitors in a particular industry or market. It&#8217;s essentially what sets a company apart and allows it to create superior value for its customers while generating higher profits.</p>
<p>There are several ways firms can achieve competitive advantage using different dimensions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Asymmetry: Asymmetry refers to the differences or imbalances between competitors in terms of resources, capabilities, or market positioning. Firms can exploit these differences to gain a competitive edge. For example, a company might have superior technology, intellectual property, or access to exclusive distribution channels that its competitors lack. By leveraging these advantages, the company can offer better products or services, attract more customers, and capture a larger market share.</li>
<li>Complementary resources: Complementary resources are assets or capabilities that, when combined, create greater value or efficiency than when used separately. Firms can achieve competitive advantage by strategically combining their resources with those of partners, suppliers, or other stakeholders. For instance, a manufacturer might collaborate with a technology company to integrate cutting-edge software into its products, enhancing their performance and appeal to customers.</li>
<li>Perfect market: While a perfectly competitive market is theoretical and rarely exists in reality, the concept can still be useful for understanding how firms can achieve competitive advantage. In a perfectly competitive market, firms have no control over prices and must compete solely on factors like product quality, customer service, and brand reputation. To gain a competitive advantage in such a market, firms must focus on differentiating themselves through innovation, efficiency, or other means to attract customers and earn profits.</li>
<li>Leverage: Leverage involves using specific tactics or strategies to amplify the impact of existing resources or capabilities. Firms can achieve competitive advantage by leveraging their strengths in ways that create additional value or opportunities. For example, a company might leverage its strong brand reputation to expand into new markets or diversify its product offerings. Similarly, firms can leverage their financial resources to invest in research and development, marketing campaigns, or acquisitions that enhance their competitive position.</li>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What is a digital wallet? How does it work? Describe the payment authorization and payment capture operations of SET.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A <strong>digital wallet</strong>, also known as an e-wallet or mobile wallet, is a software-based system that securely stores users&#8217; payment information, such as credit card details, bank account numbers, or cryptocurrency keys, for making online transactions. Digital wallets can be accessed through various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers, and they enable users to make purchases, send money to others, and manage their financial accounts conveniently and securely.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how a digital wallet typically works:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Registration</strong>: Users download a digital wallet application and create an account by providing personal information and linking their preferred payment methods, such as credit/debit cards or bank accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: To ensure the security of users&#8217; sensitive information, digital wallets employ encryption techniques and authentication mechanisms like passwords, PINs, biometrics (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition), or two-factor authentication.</li>
<li><strong>Storage of Payment Information</strong>: Once registered, users can securely store their payment information within the digital wallet. This eliminates the need to repeatedly enter payment details for each transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Initiation</strong>: When making a purchase online or in-store, users select the digital wallet as their payment method and authorize the transaction using their chosen authentication method.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Authorization</strong>: The digital wallet communicates with the payment processor or financial institution to authorize the transaction. This involves verifying the user&#8217;s identity, checking the availability of funds, and ensuring the transaction meets security standards.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Capture</strong>: Once the transaction is authorized, the payment processor captures the funds from the user&#8217;s selected payment method and transfers them to the merchant&#8217;s account. The digital wallet then records the transaction details for the user&#8217;s records.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SET</strong> was a standard developed in the 1990s to facilitate secure electronic transactions over the internet. It aimed to enhance the security of online payments by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information exchanged between buyers, sellers, and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the payment authorization and payment capture operations of SET worked:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Payment Authorization</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The buyer initiates a payment by selecting SET as the payment method and providing their digital certificate, which contains their public key and other identifying information.</li>
<li>The buyer&#8217;s digital wallet creates a payment message containing the transaction details, such as the purchase amount and merchant information.</li>
<li>The buyer&#8217;s digital wallet encrypts the payment message using the seller&#8217;s public key obtained from the seller&#8217;s digital certificate.</li>
<li>The encrypted payment message, along with the buyer&#8217;s digital certificate, is sent to the merchant&#8217;s server.</li>
<li>The merchant&#8217;s server decrypts the payment message using its private key and verifies the buyer&#8217;s digital certificate.</li>
<li>The merchant then forwards the payment message, along with its digital certificate and other necessary information, to the payment gateway or acquirer for further processing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Payment Capture</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After receiving the payment message from the merchant, the payment gateway or acquirer verifies the authenticity of the transaction and the merchant&#8217;s identity.</li>
<li>If the transaction is valid, the payment gateway or acquirer captures the funds from the buyer&#8217;s account and transfers them to the merchant&#8217;s account.</li>
<li>The payment gateway or acquirer sends a confirmation message to the merchant and the buyer, indicating that the payment has been successfully processed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What is display ad marketing? How attrition rate, view-to-cart ratio, acquisition rate and retention rate influence display ad marketing?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Display ad marketing</strong> refers to the practice of promoting products, services, or brands through visual advertisements that appear on websites, social media platforms, mobile apps, and other digital channels. These ads typically consist of images, graphics, videos, or interactive elements and are displayed to targeted audiences based on demographics, interests, browsing behavior, and other criteria.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Attrition Rate</strong>: Attrition rate refers to the rate at which customers stop engaging with a brand or product over a specific period. In display ad marketing, a high attrition rate indicates that a significant portion of the audience exposed to the ads is not converting or taking desired actions, such as making purchases or signing up for services. Analyzing attrition rate helps marketers identify potential issues with ad creatives, targeting, messaging, or user experience that may be causing audiences to disengage.</li>
<li><strong>View-to-Cart Ratio</strong>: The view-to-cart ratio measures the percentage of users who add items to their shopping carts after viewing a display ad. This metric is particularly relevant for e-commerce businesses that use display ads to drive product sales. A high view-to-cart ratio indicates that the ad effectively captures the audience&#8217;s interest and motivates them to explore further or take action. Conversely, a low view-to-cart ratio suggests that the ad may not be resonating with the target audience or that there are barriers preventing users from progressing to the next stage of the purchase funnel.</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition Rate</strong>: The acquisition rate represents the proportion of users who become new customers or subscribers as a result of interacting with display ads. It measures the effectiveness of display ad campaigns in acquiring new business opportunities or expanding the customer base. A high acquisition rate indicates that the ads are successfully attracting and converting prospects into paying customers or engaged users. Marketers can optimize their campaigns to improve the acquisition rate by refining audience targeting, optimizing ad creatives and messaging, and enhancing the user experience on landing pages or conversion paths.</li>
<li><strong>Retention Rate</strong>: Retention rate measures the percentage of customers or users who continue to engage with a brand or product over time. In the context of display ad marketing, retention rate reflects the effectiveness of ongoing campaigns in nurturing existing relationships, encouraging repeat purchases, and fostering brand loyalty. A high retention rate indicates that the ads are resonating with existing customers and reinforcing their affinity for the brand, leading to sustained engagement and repeat business. Marketers can enhance retention rate by delivering personalized ad experiences, offering relevant incentives or promotions, and providing exceptional post-purchase support or customer service.</li>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>What is EDI? Describe the significance of EDI in e-commerce? Justify your answer with an example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)</strong> is the electronic exchange of business documents, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipment notices, and other transactional information, between trading partners in a standardized format.</p>
<p>The significance of EDI in e-commerce lies in its ability to streamline and improve the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of business-to-business (B2B) transactions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: EDI eliminates the need for manual data entry and paper-based processes, reducing the time, effort, and resources required to exchange business documents between trading partners. This increases operational efficiency and enables organizations to process transactions faster, leading to shorter order-to-cash cycles and improved productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>: By standardizing the format and structure of business documents, EDI reduces the risk of errors, discrepancies, and misinterpretations that can occur with manual data entry or paper-based systems. This improves data accuracy and integrity, minimizing the likelihood of order processing errors, invoicing discrepancies, and other costly mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: EDI helps businesses save costs by eliminating the need for paper-based document storage, printing, postage, and manual labor associated with document processing. It also reduces the risk of late payments, invoice disputes, and order processing delays, leading to lower operational expenses and improved cash flow management.</li>
<li><strong>Speed and Agility</strong>: EDI enables real-time or near-real-time exchange of data between trading partners, allowing businesses to respond quickly to customer demands, market changes, and supply chain disruptions. This agility is essential in today&#8217;s fast-paced e-commerce environment, where timely order fulfillment and delivery are critical for customer satisfaction and retention.</li>
<li><strong>Integration with E-commerce Platforms</strong>: EDI can be seamlessly integrated with e-commerce platforms, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, inventory management systems, and other business applications, enabling end-to-end automation and synchronization of data across the entire supply chain. This integration streamlines business processes, enhances visibility, and facilitates better decision-making.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: Consider a retailer that sells consumer electronics products through its e-commerce website. The retailer sources products from multiple suppliers and manufacturers located around the world. To streamline its procurement process and manage inventory effectively, the retailer implements an EDI system to exchange purchase orders, shipment notices, and invoices with its suppliers electronically.</p>
<p>When the retailer needs to restock inventory, its inventory management system automatically generates a purchase order in the standardized EDI format and sends it electronically to the suppliers. The suppliers receive the purchase orders instantly, process them electronically, and prepare the requested products for shipment. Once the products are ready to be shipped, the suppliers generate electronic shipment notices (ASN) and send them to the retailer, providing details about the shipment, such as tracking numbers, quantities, and expected delivery dates.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the shipment notices, the retailer&#8217;s system automatically updates its inventory records, notifies the warehouse staff to expect incoming shipments, and prepares to receive and process the products upon arrival. When the products are delivered, the retailer receives electronic invoices from the suppliers, which are automatically matched with the corresponding purchase orders and shipment notices to reconcile the transactions.</p>
<p>In this example, EDI enables the retailer and its suppliers to exchange business documents efficiently, accurately, and electronically, leading to streamlined procurement processes, improved inventory management, and faster order fulfillment.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how virtual currency works:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>: Many virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are based on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. Each transaction is verified by network participants (miners) and added to a block, which is then linked to previous blocks, creating a chain of blocks (hence the term &#8220;blockchain&#8221;).</li>
<li><strong>Cryptography</strong>: Virtual currencies use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. Public and private keys are used to encrypt and decrypt transaction information, ensuring the security and integrity of the network.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Unlike traditional currencies, which are issued and regulated by governments or central banks, virtual currencies operate in a decentralized manner, meaning they are not controlled by any single authority. Transactions are validated and recorded by network participants, eliminating the need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors.</li>
<li><strong>Mining</strong>: Some virtual currencies, such as Bitcoin, use a process called mining to create new units and verify transactions. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, which validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. In return, miners are rewarded with newly created units of the virtual currency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Usages of virtual currency in e-commerce include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Payment Method</strong>: Virtual currencies can be used as a payment method for purchasing goods and services online. Many e-commerce merchants accept virtual currencies as a form of payment, providing customers with an alternative payment option.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Border Transactions</strong>: Virtual currencies can facilitate cross-border transactions by eliminating the need for currency conversion and reducing transaction fees associated with traditional payment methods. This makes it easier for customers to make purchases from international e-commerce websites.</li>
<li><strong>Lower Transaction Fees</strong>: Virtual currency transactions typically have lower transaction fees compared to traditional payment methods like credit cards or bank transfers. This can benefit e-commerce merchants by reducing payment processing costs and increasing profit margins.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymity and Privacy</strong>: Virtual currencies offer a certain degree of anonymity and privacy for users, as transactions are pseudonymous and not directly linked to personal identity information. This can appeal to customers who prioritize privacy when making online purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Micropayments</strong>: Virtual currencies enable micropayments, allowing users to make small transactions or pay for digital content on a per-use basis. This can be useful for e-commerce platforms that offer digital downloads, subscriptions, or pay-per-view services.</li>
</ol>
