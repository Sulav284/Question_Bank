    <h2>Group A: Attempt any two questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>In the software development process, how does software configuration management facilitate the changes that may occur during different stages of a software development life cycle? Justify your explanation with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Software Configuration Management (SCM)</strong> is the process of tracking and controlling changes to software and related documentation throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). SCM facilitates the management of changes by providing mechanisms for version control, configuration identification, change control, and configuration auditing.</p>
<p><strong>1. Version Control</strong></p>
<p>SCM enables developers to keep track of different versions of software artifacts such as source code, documents, and configurations. Version control systems (VCS) allow developers to manage changes, revert to previous versions if needed, and collaborate effectively. For example, if a developer needs to modify a source code file during the development phase, SCM ensures that previous versions are preserved, and changes are tracked. This prevents the loss of valuable code and allows for easy rollback if the modifications introduce errors.</p>
<p><strong>2. Configuration Identification</strong></p>
<p>SCM helps in identifying and managing different configurations of software products. It defines baselines for each configuration, including the set of components, their versions, and dependencies. For instance, during the testing phase, SCM ensures that the test environment is properly configured with the correct version of the software under test, along with any necessary test data and dependencies. If changes are made to the configuration, SCM ensures that the changes are documented and tracked.</p>
<p><strong>3. Change Control</strong></p>
<p>SCM provides mechanisms for controlling and managing changes to software artifacts. Change control processes ensure that proposed changes are evaluated, approved, and implemented in a controlled manner. For example, if a new feature request is received during the maintenance phase, SCM ensures that the request goes through a formal change control process. This may involve assessing the impact of the change, obtaining approvals from stakeholders, and updating documentation accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>4. Configuration Auditing</strong></p>
<p>SCM facilitates auditing of software configurations to ensure compliance with standards, policies, and regulations. Auditing helps in verifying the integrity and consistency of software artifacts across different stages of the SDLC. For instance, during the deployment phase, SCM conducts configuration audits to ensure that the deployed software matches the intended configuration specified in the release documentation. Any discrepancies or unauthorized changes are identified and addressed through corrective actions.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the main activities used in requirements engineering. What are the desirable characteristics of a good SRS documents? Explain with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>The main activities used in requirements engineering:</p>
<p><strong>Elicitation</strong></p>
<p>Elicitation involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, including end-users, customers, domain experts, and other relevant parties. The goal is to understand their needs, expectations, and constraints regarding the software system. Various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, brainstorming sessions, observations, and document analysis are commonly used to elicit requirements. Eliciting requirements can be challenging due to incomplete or inconsistent stakeholder input, changing requirements, and communication barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong>:</p>
<p>Requirement analysis focuses on understanding, refining, and organizing the gathered requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, feasible, and relevant to the project goals. It involves identifying stakeholders&#8217; needs, priorities, and conflicts and defining the scope of the system. Techniques such as requirements prioritization, requirement structuring (e.g., use case modeling, data modeling), and requirements validation (e.g., reviews, prototyping) are used during analysis. Analyzing requirements requires balancing conflicting priorities, managing changing requirements, and ensuring alignment with the overall project objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Specification</strong>:</p>
<p>Requirement specification involves documenting the elicited and analyzed requirements in a structured format to ensure clarity, completeness, and unambiguity. The specifications serve as a baseline for the development team and other stakeholders. Specifications may include textual descriptions, diagrams (e.g., use cases, activity diagrams, class diagrams), prototypes, formal models, or a combination of these depending on the project&#8217;s needs. Specifying requirements requires translating stakeholder needs into precise and understandable terms, avoiding ambiguity, and ensuring that all relevant aspects of the system are adequately described.</p>
<p><strong>Validation</strong>:</p>
<p>Requirement validation ensures that the specified requirements accurately represent stakeholders&#8217; needs and can be implemented to achieve the desired objectives. It involves verifying the correctness, consistency, completeness, and verifiability of the requirements. Validation techniques include reviews (e.g., walkthroughs, inspections), prototyping, simulation, and validation testing. Validating requirements requires addressing conflicts and inconsistencies, managing stakeholder expectations, and ensuring that the requirements align with the system&#8217;s goals and constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Management</strong>:</p>
<p>Requirement management involves tracking changes to requirements, ensuring traceability between requirements and other project artifacts, and maintaining consistency throughout the development process. It also includes communication and collaboration among stakeholders to address evolving requirements. Requirement management tools, version control systems, and collaboration platforms are used to manage requirements effectively. Managing requirements involves handling changes, controlling scope creep, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that requirements remain aligned with the project&#8217;s goals and constraints.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</strong> document serves as a comprehensive guide that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system to be developed. Some desirable characteristics of a good SRS document:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Clear and Unambiguous</strong>: The SRS should be written in clear and concise language without ambiguity. It should be easily understandable by all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and clients.</li>
<li><strong>Complete</strong>: The document should capture all relevant requirements, including functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (quality attributes such as performance, usability, security, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Consistent</strong>: The requirements specified in the SRS should be consistent with each other and should not contradict one another.</li>
<li><strong>Correct</strong>: The requirements should accurately reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Verifiable</strong>: Each requirement should be verifiable, meaning it should be possible to determine whether the system meets that requirement once it is implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Traceable</strong>: The SRS should provide traceability between the requirements and their sources (e.g., stakeholder requests, business processes) and between requirements and other system artifacts (e.g., design documents, test cases).</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: Let&#8217;s consider an example of an SRS document for an online shopping website:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Functional Requirement</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>FR1: The system shall allow users to browse products by category.</li>
<li>FR2: The system shall allow users to add products to their shopping cart.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Non-functional Requirement</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>NFR1: The system shall respond to user actions within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Traceability</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>TR1: FR1 is derived from stakeholder interviews conducted with potential users.</li>
<li>TR2: FR2 is derived from the business requirement to facilitate easy shopping experience for users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain architectural views. Illustrate on layered architecture, repository architecture, and pipe and filter architecture.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Architectural views</strong> provide different perspectives or abstractions of a software system&#8217;s architecture, each focusing on specific aspects of the system. These views help stakeholders understand different aspects of the system&#8217;s design and aid in communication between various stakeholders involved in the software development process.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Layered Architecture</strong></span></p>
<p>Layered architecture organizes the system into horizontal layers where each layer represents a different level of abstraction or functionality. Each layer provides services to the layer above it and consumes services from the layer below it.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Presentation Layer: Handles user interaction and interfaces.</li>
<li>Application Layer: Implements business logic and workflows.</li>
<li>Data Access Layer: Manages data access and storage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Separation of concerns: Each layer focuses on specific responsibilities.</li>
<li>Modifiability: Changes in one layer do not necessarily affect other layers.</li>
<li>Reusability: Layers can be reused in different parts of the system.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Repository Architecture</strong></span></p>
<p>Repository architecture centralizes data management by using a repository or a centralized store for data. It separates the business logic from data access and manipulation operations.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Repository: Acts as a central store for data storage and retrieval.</li>
<li>Business Logic: Implements application-specific logic.</li>

<li>Centralized data management: Simplifies data access and ensures consistency.</li>
<li>Encapsulation: Business logic is decoupled from data access operations.</li>
<li>Flexibility: Allows for easier integration with different data sources.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Pipe and Filter Architecture</strong></span></p>
<p>Pipe and filter architecture decomposes the system into a series of components (filters) connected by communication channels (pipes). Each filter performs a specific transformation or processing task on data passing through it.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Filters: Individual components responsible for processing data.</li>
<li>Pipes: Channels through which data flows between filters.</li>
<li>Source Filter: Produces initial data.</li>
<li>Sink Filter: Consumes processed data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Modularity: Filters are independent and can be easily added, removed, or modified.</li>
<li>Reusability: Filters can be reused in different configurations.</li>
<li>Scalability: Supports parallel processing and distributed architectures.</li>
</ul>

<div><p><p>Explain the behavioral model with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>In software engineering, the behavioral model refers to a type of model that focuses on describing the dynamic behavior of a software system. It emphasizes how the system responds to various inputs, events, and stimuli, as well as how it transitions between different states or behaviors over time. Behavioral models are commonly used to specify the functional requirements of a system and to illustrate the system&#8217;s behavior in response to user interactions or external events.</p>
<p>One popular method for representing behavioral models is through Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and state machine diagrams. These diagrams provide visual representations of the system&#8217;s behavior, helping stakeholders understand how the system functions and interacts with its environment.</p>

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain COCOMO model.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a widely used software cost estimation model developed by Barry Boehm in the late 1970s and later extended and refined. COCOMO provides a framework for estimating the effort, time, and resources required to develop a software project based on various factors such as project size, complexity, and development environment. COCOMO is based on empirical data collected from numerous software projects and has evolved into several versions to accommodate different development environments and project characteristics.</p>
<p>There are three main versions of the COCOMO model:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Basic COCOMO (COCOMO I):</strong> Basic COCOMO is the original version of the model and is primarily used for early-stage rough estimates of software projects. It estimates software development effort as a function of the project size measured in lines of code (LOC). The formula for Basic COCOMO is as follows: Effort (E) = a * (KLOC)^bWhere:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>E is the effort required to develop the software project.</li>
<li>KLOC is the estimated size of the software project in thousands of lines of code.</li>
<li>a and b are constants derived from historical data and depend on the project type and development environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <strong>Intermediate COCOMO (COCOMO II):</strong> Intermediate COCOMO extends the basic model by incorporating additional factors that influence software development effort and cost. It introduces different cost drivers that affect the overall project effort, including product, platform, personnel, project, and process attributes. These cost drivers are categorized into various factors such as product complexity, development environment, team experience, and project constraints. The formula for Intermediate COCOMO is more complex than Basic COCOMO and accounts for these additional factors.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed COCOMO (COCOMO III):</strong> Detailed COCOMO is the most comprehensive version of the model and provides a detailed breakdown of effort estimation by considering individual software development activities and phases. It takes into account factors such as software requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Detailed COCOMO allows for a more fine-grained estimation of effort and resources based on specific project characteristics and development methodologies.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Advantages of COCOMO:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Provides a structured and systematic approach to software cost estimation.</li>
<li>Accounts for various project factors and attributes that influence development effort.</li>
<li>Can be tailored to different types of software projects and development environments.</li>
<li>Relies on empirical data and historical experience, making it more accurate and reliable.</li>
<li>Helps in early-stage project planning and budgeting, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of COCOMO:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Requires accurate estimation of project size and other input parameters, which may be challenging, especially for large and complex projects.</li>
<li>Assumes a linear relationship between project size and effort, which may not always hold true in practice.</li>
<li>Does not consider factors such as team dynamics, organizational culture, and external dependencies, which can significantly impact project outcomes.</li>
<li>May not be suitable for projects using modern development approaches such as agile or iterative methodologies, as it is based on traditional waterfall development models.</li>
</ul>
