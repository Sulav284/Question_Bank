<p>In e-commerce, cryptography plays a crucial role in ensuring data and message transaction security. Here&#8217;s how cryptography is used in e-commerce to safeguard sensitive information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Secure Data Transmission:</strong> When sensitive data, such as credit card information or personal details, is transmitted between the customer&#8217;s device and the e-commerce server, cryptography is used to encrypt this data. This process ensures that even if the data is intercepted during transmission, it remains unreadable and protected from unauthorized access.</li>
<li><strong>SSL/TLS Encryption</strong>: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols use cryptographic techniques to encrypt data during internet communication. SSL/TLS certificates are used to authenticate websites and establish a secure encrypted connection between the customer&#8217;s web browser and the e-commerce server, protecting data during online transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):</strong> PKI is a system that uses a pair of cryptographic keys, a public key for encryption, and a private key for decryption. PKI is used in digital certificates, digital signatures, and secure email communication, providing authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality to e-commerce transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Digital signatures are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of electronic documents, such as purchase orders and invoices, in e-commerce. The sender&#8217;s private key is used to sign the document, and the recipient can use the sender&#8217;s public key to verify the signature and ensure the document&#8217;s origin.</li>
<li><strong>One-Time Passwords (OTP</strong>): OTPs are used as an additional layer of security for user authentication during e-commerce transactions. OTPs are generated using cryptographic algorithms and are valid for single use, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if the password is intercepted.</li>
