<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The various stages of e-governance are:</p>
<p><strong>Stage – 1 (Presence):</strong> The presence of information on the various platforms of government such as websites, e-brochures etc makes the first stage of E-governance. In the first stage, the activity involves the development and establishment and delivery of information for stakeholder use. This stage is the simplest, non-expensive phase in the implementation of E-governance, but it gives only little option for the stakeholders. For example, the website of the Ministry of environment publishes only cursory information about the ministry, information of officers, their contact details, address for communication, report they published, various orders etc, but there is a one-way flow of information and don’t have interactive capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Stage – 2 (Interaction):</strong> The second stage of the E-governance model is the advanced version of the first stage which involves the interaction between the government and stakeholders such as businessmen or interested groups or citizens. It is a two-way communication or interaction which involves the real means of communication. In this stage citizens or stakeholders can communicate with the government via E-mail, chat database, customer care platform, feedback forms or submission of online forms. It ensures the transparency of communication and accountability of government offices. It also reduces the physical interaction of stakeholders and governance, which also saves labour hours.</p>
<p><strong>Stage – 3 (Transaction):</strong> The third stage of E-governance involves the transactions made between<br />
stakeholder and government. In this stage, the government’s e-governance efforts make the life of citizens easier by enabling electronic transactions and simplifying government processes. Government, Businesses and Departments can avail services by making a payment online for services such as licence renewal, online bidding and deposition of the bid amount, paying taxes online, and paying for various services provided by the government. The level of interaction in this stage is higher than in the second stage and more activities are involved in the flow of information, mainly one-way activities such as government to client or client to government. Eg. Bidding for procurement, licence renewal fee payment, fee payment for a patent application, submission of job application with fee payment etc.</p>
<p><strong>Stage– 4 (Transformation):</strong> This phase is the highest in order for e-governance initiatives. This level<br />
involves exhausting the full use of available technology to transform the government service by receiving information, organisation and analysing information and execution. This is the two-way flow of information to improve the stakeholder relationship with the government and the service provider<br />
should have robust capabilities to handle the issues, needs, and solving of problems of stakeholders. Right now there are very few options in the government that follow this phase of E-governance. The<br />
main advantage of this stage is to provide a seamless flow of information by the service provider and collaborative decision-making among the union, state, local, citizens and private interest groups. It<br />
removes the organisational barrier as well as reduces the Red-tapism behaviour of government officers by sticking them to follow time-bound decision-making. Eg. E-court, Virtual summit etc.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain with example of maturity model of e-governance.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A maturity model is a method for judging the maturity of the processes of an organization and for identifying the key practices that are required to increase the maturity of these processes. An eGovernment maturity model provides us with guidance on how to gain control of our processes for developing and maintaining eGovernment services and how to evolve toward a culture of excellence in providing and managing eGovernment.</p>
<p><strong>Closed</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Organizations are closed to e-governance. No plans or vision is available.</p>
<p>&#8211; They continue with fully manual and conventional operations.</p>
<p>&#8211; This is the stage when an organization does not use ICT as a facilitator for good governance and has no plans to do so in the near future.</p>
<p>&#8211; This situation may arise due to a lack of exposure to ICTs and associated benefits that again may depend upon a number of reasons: remoteness from the mainstream in terms of location is primary, and lack of resources and strategic thinking could be some of the other issues.</p>
<p><strong>Initial</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; The organization lacks strategic thinking and direction for e-governance at the top level.</p>
<p>&#8211; The effort sustains as long as the enthusiasm of the individual, who initiated it, remains and is often abandoned due to lack of direction.</p>
<p>&#8211; Such organizations generally accumulate hardware without any planning and much of it goes unutilized or underutilized.</p>
<p>&#8211; This level corresponds to the stage when an organization has initiated the automation of its processes but on an ad-hoc(On required) basis.</p>
<p>&#8211; No organized efforts are made to undertake the e-governance initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Planned</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; E-governance is a part of the organization&#8217;s agenda.</p>
<p>&#8211; Strategic thinking and leadership guide the e-governance initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8211; Clear understanding of e-governance needs as projected by the external and internal customers/users.</p>
<p>&#8211; A need assessment study is conducted to prioritize areas of implementation and gauge the extent of e-readiness.</p>
<p>&#8211; Taking input from the assessment study, extensive planning has been carried out indicating policies, strategies, various activities, stakeholders, roles and responsibilities, and resources required in terms of time, money and manpower to undertake the e-governance exercise.</p>
<p>&#8211; However, the organization is yet to enter into the planned implementation of the e-governance exercise, even though all the requisite planning is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Realized</strong><br />
&#8211; This level corresponds to the stage when the organization actually realizes the complete e-governance plan.</p>
<p>&#8211; Consequently, an integrated system is established where all the internal processes of the organization are computerized and there is seamless information exchange among all concerned entities.</p>
<p>&#8211; The organization starts delivering the services to its external as well as internal customers/users in an effective manner.</p>
<p>&#8211; Complete realization of the plan, in a single instance, would entail an enormous amount of resources in terms of time, money, and manpower, which may necessitate adopting a phased approach for the operation of the e-governance services.</p>
<p><strong>Institutionalized</strong><br />
&#8211; At this level, the organizations sustain the realized state over a period of time so that e-governance becomes part of its work culture.</p>
<p>&#8211; The e-governance services are effectively utilized and accepted by the users.</p>
<p>&#8211; Several iterations between planned and realized states lead to institutionalization when e-governance becomes a way of life.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the components of data warehouse. What are the applications of data mining in eGovernance in the context of Nepal.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>The Components of a Data Warehouse are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Data Sources:</strong> These are the various databases, applications, and systems from which data is extracted and loaded into the data warehouse. Data sources can include operational databases, spreadsheets, CRM systems, ERP systems, and more.</p>
<p><strong>2. Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL):</strong> ETL is the process of extracting data from different sources, transforming it into a consistent format, and loading it into the data warehouse. This step ensures that data is clean, integrated, and ready for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>3. Data Storage:</strong> The data warehouse stores data in a structured manner to enable efficient querying and analysis. Common storage methods include star schema, snowflake schema, and data cubes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Data Modeling:</strong> Data modeling involves creating a logical representation of the data in the data warehouse, such as dimensional models, to facilitate efficient querying and reporting.</p>
<p><strong>5. Metadata:</strong> Metadata contains information about the data in the data warehouse, including data definitions, data sources, transformation rules, and relationships between data elements.</p>
<p><strong>6. Query and Reporting Tools:</strong> These tools allow users to access and query the data warehouse to generate reports, perform ad-hoc analysis, and gain insights from the data.</p>
<p><strong>7. Data Governance:</strong> Data governance encompasses policies, procedures, and rules to ensure data quality, security, and compliance within the data warehouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Applications of Data Mining in e-Governance in the Context of Nepal:</strong><br />
&#8211; Data mining can help identify fraudulent activities and transactions in various government processes, such as tax collection, public procurement, and social welfare programs.</p>
<p>&#8211; Data mining can assist in optimizing resource allocation by analyzing historical data and patterns to identify areas where resources are most needed and where they can be best utilized.</p>
<p>&#8211; By analyzing data from various government departments and agencies, data mining can aid in policy formulation, decision-making processes, and evidence-based governance.</p>
<p>&#8211; Data mining can be used to analyze citizen behavior, preferences, and feedback, which can help in improving public services and tailoring governance initiatives to meet citizens&#8217; needs.</p>
<p>&#8211; Data mining can be applied to predict demand for public services, such as healthcare, education, and transportation, allowing government agencies to better plan and allocate resources accordingly.</p>
</div>
<h2>Group B: Attempt any eight questions.</h2><h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the critical flow model in e-Governance.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Critical flow model</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; The model is based on broadcasting information of &#8216;critical&#8217; value (which by its very nature will not be disclosed by those involved with bad governance practices) to a targeted audience using ICTs and other tools. The targeted audience may include media, affected parties, opposition parties, judicial bench, independent investigators, or the general public.</p>
<p>&#8211; Those who would divulge(reveal) such information could include upright officials and workers, whistleblowers, affected parties, and those who were themselves involved in bad governance practices but have now changed their minds or may wish to trade such information for lenient(soft) punishments</p>
<p><strong>Applications :</strong></p>
<p>This model could be applied in the following possible ways :</p>
<p>&#8211; Making available corruption-related data about a particular Ministry / Division/ Officials online to its electoral constituency or to the concerned regulatory body.</p>
<p>&#8211; Making available Research studies, Enquiry reports, and Impact studies commissioned by the Government or Independent commissions to the affected parties.</p>
<p>&#8211; Making Human Rights Violations cases violations freely available to Judiciary, NGOs, and concerned citizens.</p>
<p>&#8211; Making available information that is usually suppressed, for instance, Environmental Information on radioactivity spills, effluents discharge, and Information on green ratings of the company to the concerned community.</p>
<p><strong>Merits :</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; This model is more directed and evolved.</p>
<p>&#8211; Different organizations can use it differently depending on the aspect of governance and the situation they want to address.</p>
<p>&#8211; The model corrects information failure, raises awareness about bad governance practices, and acts as a hindrance to bad governance practices.</p>
<p>&#8211; Also, the model exerts indirect pressure on the concerned governance institution / policy-making body to move away from an optimal ignorance attitude to reform and take into cognizance the interest and opinion of the masses in decision-making processes.</p>
<p><strong>Demerits :</strong><br />
&#8211; The model may not work in cases where the governance mechanism does not allow public debates and opinions and censures all information of critical nature.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>What do you mean by e-Readiness framework? Explain with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>E-Readiness</strong> is the ability to use information and communication technologies (ICT) to develop one&#8217;s economy and foster one&#8217;s welfare. It Is the ability to pursue value-creation opportunities facilitated by the use of the Internet. It is not simply a matter of the number of computer servers, websites, and mobile phones in the country, but also things such as its citizen&#8217;s ability to utilize technology skillfully, the transparency of its business and legal systems, and the extent to which governments encourage the use of digital technologies.<br />
Example: Legal infrastructural preparedness</p>
<p><strong>Legal infrastructural preparedness</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; The manual processes in government are usually obsolete, inefficient, and bureaucratic.</p>
<p>&#8211; Though they have transformed to computerization practices, they continue to have poor and inefficient performance and this is due to a lack of administrative reforms and a lack of business process reengineering.</p>
<p>&#8211; They lack the requisite legislation and legal infrastructure to enable such reforms or reengineering of the existing business practices, rules, and regulations within the government at various levels.</p>
<p>&#8211; This seems to be accentuated (emphasized) in developing countries while developed countries have been significantly successful in administrative reforms and business reengineering.</p>
<p>&#8211; The fundamental question that arises here is &#8220;Are the laws and regulations required to permit and support the move towards e-governance initiatives in place?</p>
<p>&#8211; E.g Digital Signature Act</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>Discuss the main impact of e-Governance application in digital divide.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>e-Governance applications can have both positive and negative impacts on the digital divide, which refers to the gap between those who have access to and can effectively use information and communication technologies (ICTs) and those who do not. Its main impacts:</p>
<p><strong>1. Bridging the Divide:</strong></p>
<p>e-Governance applications have the potential to bridge the digital divide by providing greater access to government services and information. As e-Governance initiatives are implemented, citizens can access public services, interact with government agencies, and obtain information online. This can be especially beneficial for people in remote or underserved areas who may have limited access to physical government offices.</p>
<p><strong>2. Empowerment and Participation:</strong></p>
<p>e-Governance applications can empower citizens to participate more actively in the governance process. e-Governance initiatives are accessible to all citizens, regardless of their digital literacy or access to technology.</p>
<p><strong>3. Digital Literacy and Skills Gap:</strong><br />
The success of e-Governance applications depends on the digital literacy and skills of the citizens. People who lack digital literacy or skills may find it challenging to navigate e-Governance platforms and understand the processes involved. Governments need to invest in digital literacy programs and support to ensure that citizens can effectively use these services.</p>
<p><strong>4. Privacy and Security Concerns:</strong><br />
e-Governance applications deal with sensitive citizen data, and security and privacy are critical concerns. A digital divide can be exacerbated if some citizens are apprehensive about using e-Governance services due to concerns about data breaches or misuse of personal information.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the current trends of e-Governance development in Nepal.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Although Nepal stands at the lower position in the global scenario of ICT, there have been noticeable developments in the ICT sector in recent years. The telecommunication facilities have improved remarkably. The academic institutions/universities producing ICT professional resources have been expanded. Communication technologies, both electronic and print media, have extended their access to general people. Uses of the Internet, emails. and computers are gaining popularity. Several e-government applications are being introduced. Among the country&#8217;s recent e-government initiatives. Nepal&#8217;s e-government Master Plan was completed in November 2006. Another milestone is the preparation of an ICT Development Project which has worked out detailed investment proposals for prioritized projects. The Government of Nepal is thus keen and committed to promoting e-government for the implementation of various G2G, G2C, and G2B projects defined under respective priority areas.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the Comparative Analysis Model with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Comparative Analysis Model</strong><br />
• The Comparative Analysis Model is based on exploring the information available in the public or private domain and comparing it with the actual known information sets to derive strategic learnings and arguments.</p>
<p>• This model empowers people by comparing cases of bad governance with those of good governance and identifying specific aspects of bad governance, the reasons and people behind them, and how the situation can be improved.</p>
<p>• The comparison could be made over a time scale to get a snapshot of the past and the present situation or could be used to compare the effectiveness of an intervention by comparing two similar situations.</p>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
<p>• To learn from past policies and actions and derive learning lessons for future policy-making.</p>
<p>• To evaluate the effectiveness of the current policies and identify key learning in terms of strengths and flaws in the policies.</p>
<p>• To effectively establish conditions of precedence, especially in the case of Judicial or legal decision-making ( for resolving (patent-related disputes, public goods ownership rights), and use it to influence/ advocate future decision-making.</p>
<p>• To evaluate the performance and track record of a particular decision-maker/decision-making body.</p>
<p><strong>Merits :</strong></p>
<p>• Based on the existing sets of information</p>
<p>• Watch-guard organizations and monitor groups can use this model to continuously track the governance past record and performance and compare with different information sets.</p>
<p><strong>Demerits :</strong></p>
<p>• Requires the ability to analyze and bring out strong arguments</p>
<p>• Ineffective in the absence of a strong civil society interest and public memory which is essential to force decision-makers to improve existing governance practices.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the pre-requisites of e-readiness for intra structure development.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>E-readiness means the infrastructural prerequisites for taking up any e-governance project. These infrastructural pre-requisites or preconditions may be identified as:</p>
<p>i. Data system infrastructural preparedness</p>
<p>ii. Legal infrastructural preparedness.</p>
<p>iii. Human infrastructural preparedness.</p>
<p>iv. Institutional infrastructural preparedness.</p>
<p>v. Technological infrastructural preparedness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>i. Data System Infrastructure Preparedness:</strong></p>
<p>The core of e-governance is e-MIS, the electronic Management Information System. The data that were managed manually need to be computerized or brought into an electronic form which means that the preparedness of a computerized database or data warehouse is required. Data quality and data security are of prime concern here as most of the government infrastructures are not up to the mark in developing countries. This is the core computerization activity of any government process which may take several years to reach up to this stage.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Legal Infrastructure Preparedness:</strong></p>
<p>They lack the necessary laws and legal infrastructure to enable the reengineering of the existing business practices, rules, and regulations within the government at various levels. This seems to have been significantly successful in administrative reforms and business reengineering. The fundamental question that arises here is &#8220;Are the laws and regulations required to permit and support the move toward e-governance initiatives in place?&#8221;. Example: Digital Signature Act.</p>
<p><strong>iii. Institutional Infrastructure Preparedness:</strong></p>
<p>For any government to implement a successful e-governance project, the required institutional infrastructure must be in place which most of the government lack. The government body has to establish a separate IT department that basically coordinates with e-government projects within the nation. The IT department works out for the hardware selection and acquirement, network, or software development, and implementation, and also the training of staff at various levels of government. Many countries still lack institutional infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>iv. Human Infrastructural Preparedness:</strong></p>
<p>Human resource development by training is an essential requirement that comes from well-trained manpower, both technical and non-technical. Technical manpower resources are essential for all the phases of e-governance and related information system life cycle comprising systems analysis, design, programming, implementation, operation, and documentation. Both private and government institutions should play a major role in this regard. Apart from technical human infrastructure, there is a need for training and orientation of user personnel. Such training will make them capable of handling e-governance projects.</p>
<p><strong>v. Technological Infrastructural Preparedness:</strong></p>
<p>Technology is fast changing in the ICT domain and there is a requirement of great financial support time for software and hardware. Government organizations encounter this situation, especially in their procedures. The technological infrastructure in developing countries including computing and telecommunication is absent. As a result software and hardware may not be compatible.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<div><p><p>How can you develop the rural area through e-governance?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Developing rural areas through e-governance can significantly improve the delivery of public services, enhance communication, and empower the local community. Here are some ways e-governance can contribute to rural development:</p>
<p><strong>1. Digital Access and Connectivity:</strong> Establishing digital infrastructure, such as internet connectivity and digital service centers, enables rural communities to access government services, information, and resources more easily.</p>
<p><strong>2. E-services:</strong> Implementing e-services, such as online applications for government schemes, agricultural information portals, and digital healthcare services, can improve accessibility to essential services for rural residents.</p>
<p><strong>3. Agricultural Support:</strong> E-governance can provide farmers with real-time weather forecasts, market prices, agricultural best practices, and access to agricultural extension services, helping improve productivity and income.</p>
<p><strong>4. Education and Skill Development:</strong> E-learning platforms and digital skill development initiatives can offer educational resources and vocational training to rural residents, enhancing their employability and economic opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>5. Healthcare Services:</strong> Telemedicine and digital health initiatives can facilitate remote healthcare consultations, disease monitoring, and timely access to medical advice, improving health outcomes in rural areas.</p>
<p><strong>6. Government-to-Citizen (G2C) Services:</strong> E-governance can streamline G2C services, enabling citizens to apply for various documents like birth certificates, land records, or social welfare schemes without physically visiting government offices.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the strategic planning important for e-Government implementation.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Strategic planning</strong> is crucial for the successful implementation of e-Government initiatives. It involves the process of defining clear objectives, setting priorities, and creating a roadmap to achieve long-term goals in a systematic and coordinated manner. Here&#8217;s why strategic planning is essential for eGovernment implementation:</p>
<p>&#8211; Strategic planning ensures that e-Government initiatives align with the broader goals and objectives of the government. It helps identify how technology can support and enhance public service delivery, governance efficiency, and citizen engagement.</p>
<p>&#8211; By creating a well-defined plan, governments can allocate resources effectively. Strategic planning enables decision-makers to prioritize investments, allocate budgets, and optimize the use of human and financial resources for e-Government projects.</p>
<p>&#8211; Strategic planning helps identify potential risks and challenges in e-Government implementation. It allows governments to devise risk mitigation strategies, anticipate obstacles, and plan contingencies to ensure smooth execution.</p>
<p>&#8211; Strategic planning emphasizes the importance of citizen needs and expectations. It ensures that e-Government solutions are designed to be user-friendly, accessible, and tailored to address specific citizen requirements.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the main contents are needed for human resource management software? Explain.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Human Resource Management (HRM)</strong> software should include various modules and features to efficiently manage HR-related processes and tasks. The main contents needed for effective HRM software are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Employee Information Management:</strong> This module includes a centralized database to store and manage essential employee information, such as personal details, contact information, employment history, qualifications, certifications, and performance records.</p>
<p><strong>2. Recruitment and Applicant Tracking:</strong> This module assists in the entire recruitment process, from posting job openings to managing applications, shortlisting candidates, and conducting interviews. It should facilitate applicant tracking, interview scheduling, and communication with candidates.</p>
<p><strong>3. Payroll Management:</strong> The payroll module handles salary calculations, deductions, tax calculations, and generating payslips. It should be capable of integrating with attendance and leave data to ensure accurate and timely payroll processing.</p>
<p><strong>4. Training and Development:</strong> This module manages employee training needs, tracks completed training programs and identifies skill gaps. It assists in planning and delivering training sessions for skill enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Employee Self-Service (ESS):</strong> ESS enables employees to access their own information, apply for leaves, view payslips, and update personal details, reducing administrative burden and promoting self-sufficiency.</p>
<p><strong>6. Compliance and Document Management:</strong> This module ensures compliance with employment laws and regulations. It also manages and stores important HR-related documents, such as contracts, policies, and employee records.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<div><p><p>Write short notes:<br />
a. IT in Judiciary<br />
b. E-Payment</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>IT in Judiciary:</strong></p>
<p>Information Technology (IT) plays a crucial role in the judiciary, transforming the way courts and legal systems operate. An example of IT in Judiciary is a case management system. IT enables the implementation of electronic case management systems, which digitally store and manage case-related information, documents, and records. These systems streamline court processes, facilitate efficient scheduling and tracking of cases, and enable judges, lawyers, and other stakeholders to access case information electronically. Case management systems improve the efficiency of court operations, reduce paperwork and enhance transparency and accountability.</p>
<p><strong>E-Payment</strong></p>
