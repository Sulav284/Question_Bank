<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>Define Central limit theorem. The life of a certain brand of an electric bulb may be considered a random variable with mean 1350 hours and standard deviation 55o hours. Using central limit theorem, find the probability that the average life time of 100 bulbs exceeds 1440 hours.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</strong>:</p>
<p>The Central Limit Theorem is a fundamental concept in statistics that states that the distribution of the sample means (or sums) of a large enough number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal (Gaussian) distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the individual random variables. In other words, when you take multiple random samples from a population and calculate the means of those samples, the distribution of those sample means will be approximately normal, even if the original population is not normally distributed.</p>
<p>The Central Limit Theorem has several key components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>The sample size should be sufficiently large. There is no fixed rule for what constitutes &#8220;sufficiently large,&#8221; but a common guideline is that a sample size of 30 or greater is often adequate.</li>
<li>The samples should be independent, which means that the outcome of one sample does not affect the outcome of another.</li>
<li>The individual random variables should have a finite mean (μ) and finite variance (σ^2).</li>
</ol>
<p>Given data:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Mean (μ) of the electric bulb lifetime = 1350 hours.</li>
<li>Standard deviation (σ) of the electric bulb lifetime = 550 hours.</li>
<li>Sample size (n) = 100 bulbs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to find the probability that the average lifetime of 100 bulbs exceeds 1440 hours. To do this, we can standardize the problem using the Central Limit Theorem.</p>
<p>The formula for the standardization of a sample mean is:</p>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>Define type I and type II error in testing of hypothesis. It is claimed that Samsung and Huwaei mobiles are equally popular in Kathmandu. A random sample of 600 people from Kathmandu showed 350 have Samsung mobile. Test the claim at 5% level of significance.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>1. Type I Error (False Positive)</strong>:</p>
<p>Type I error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually true is incorrectly rejected. In other words, it&#8217;s a false positive result.</p>
<p>This error is often denoted as α (alpha), which represents the level of significance, and it indicates the probability of making a Type I error.</p>
<p>Type I errors are considered more serious in situations where making an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis has significant consequences or costs. For example, in medical testing, a Type I error might mean diagnosing a healthy person as having a disease.</p>
<p><strong>2. Type II Error (False Negative)</strong>:</p>
<p>Type II error occurs when a null hypothesis that is actually false is incorrectly not rejected. It&#8217;s a false negative result.</p>
<p>This error is often denoted as β (beta) and is used to represent the probability of making a Type II error.</p>
<p>Type II errors can be problematic when failing to reject the null hypothesis means that a real effect or relationship goes undetected. For example, in medical testing, a Type II error might mean failing to diagnose a person who actually has a disease.</p>

<p><strong>c. Stochastic process.</strong></p>
<p>A stochastic process, also known as a random process, is a mathematical concept used in probability theory and statistics to model and analyze the evolution of a system or a phenomenon over time. It&#8217;s essentially a collection of random variables, each of which represents a state or an outcome at a specific point in time. Here are some key points about stochastic processes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Random Variables Over Time:</strong> A stochastic process involves random variables that evolve with time. Each random variable represents the state of the system or process at a particular time point.</li>
<li><strong>Sequential Nature:</strong> Stochastic processes are inherently sequential in nature. You can think of them as a sequence or a collection of random events or observations that unfold over time.</li>
<li><strong>Classification:</strong> Stochastic processes can be classified into different types based on various characteristics. Common classifications include discrete-time vs. continuous-time processes, stationary vs. non-stationary processes, and Markov vs. non-Markov processes, among others.</li>
<li><strong>Applications:</strong> Stochastic processes find applications in various fields, such as finance, physics, engineering, biology, and economics. For example, in finance, they are used to model stock prices, in physics to simulate random motion, and in biology to study population dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Markov Property:</strong> In a Markov process, the future behavior of the process depends only on its present state and not on its past states. This property is often used to simplify the analysis of stochastic processes.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Common examples of stochastic processes include the Poisson process (used to model the arrival of events over time), Brownian motion (used to describe random motion), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models (used for time series analysis).</li>
<li><strong>Modeling and Analysis:</strong> Stochastic processes are used to model uncertainty and randomness in real-world phenomena. They allow researchers and analysts to make probabilistic predictions and assess the likelihood of various outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Stochastic processes are often used in Monte Carlo simulations, a technique for estimating the behavior of complex systems by repeatedly sampling random variables to understand the range of possible outcomes.</li>
