</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What is parallel efficiency of map-reduce means? Compare between thread, task and map-reduce.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Parallel efficiency of map reduce means the effectivness of utilizing computational resources and achieving speedup when executing a mapreduce job on a distributed computing system. It measures how well the system scales and utilizes available resources to perform the required computation in parallel.</p>
<p>$$Parallel Efficiency = \frac{{Actual Speedup}}{{number of processor}}*100$$</p>
<p>Here, SpeedUp represents the improvement in performance achieved by parallel execution compared to a sequential execution. A parallel efficiency of 100% indicates that parallel execution is utilizing all available resources effictively. However, in practice achieving 100% is challenging.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the data produced sfter the map phase is σ D data (postmap). Further we assume that there are P processors. Assume WD is useful work needed to be done.</p>
<p>Now agter the map operation, each mapper writes $$\frac{{σ D}}{{P}}$$</p>
<p>data to their local disk.</p>
<p>Overheads: $$\frac{{σ D}}{{P}}$$</p>
<p>Next, this data has to be read by each reduces before it can begin &#8216;reduce operationsso each reduce has to read $$\frac{{σ D}}{{P^2}}$$ i.e one path of data from particular mapper. Since, there are P different reduces, the communication time that a reducer spends getting the data it requires from different mappers as: $$\frac{{σ D}}{{P}}$$</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What is virtualization? Why is virtualization perefect of cloud computing? Discuss different types of virtualization.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Virtualization refers to the technique of creating virtual version on representation of various computing resources such as servers, storage devices, networks and operating systems.</p>
<p>It involves abstracting the physical infrastructure and dividing it into multiple virtual environments that can be used independentely by different users or applications.</p>
<p>The virtualization process utilizes specialized software called hypervisor or virtual machine monitors (VMMs) to create and manage  virtual machines(VMs). the virtualised entities aperated as self-contained units complete with their own OS and applications, while sharing the underlying physical resources.</p>
<p>Virualization is perfect for cloud computing because virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a singl physical machine, which leads to more efficient use of hardware resources. This resduces the number of physical servers needen, leading to cost savings and reduced energy consumption. Virtual machines can be easily created, cloned, and resized, allowing cloud providers to quickly scale services up or down in response to changing workloads.</p>
<p>Types of Virtualization:</p>
<p><strong>Server Virtualization/ Machine virtual</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>It is the process of dividing a physical server into several virtual servers, called virtual private server. Each VPS cab run independently with its qwn OS and application</li>
<li>This enables efficient utilization of server resources ans allows multiome users or application to store the same physical server.</li>
<li>For small to medium scale application, virtualizing servers is frequently a good choice. It is commonly used to provide low cost web hosting services as well.</li>
<li>Benefits: Higher server availability, Cheaper operating costs, eliminate server complexity, increased application performances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Network Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>It refers to the management and monitoring of an entire computer network as a single administrative entity.</li>
<li>It allows the creation of virtual networks that can be allocated, managed and configured independently.</li>
<li>Admins can monitor diverse network infrastructure parts such as routers and switches from a single software based admin panel</li>
<li>It contributes to the network optimization in terms of data trsnsmission speeds, flexibility, dependability, security and scalability.</li>
<li>It is espically usful in networks that experiences sudden or inexpected spikes in consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>Types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Software Defined Networking(SDN) virtualizes hardware that controls network traffic routing.</li>
<li>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) virtualizes hardware apploances that provide network specific functions easier to configure and manage eg: firewall etc</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Desktop virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Desktop virtualization provides a way for user to maintain their individual desktops on a single, central server. the user may be connected to the central server through a WAN, LAN or over the internet.</li>
<li>It has many benefits including a lower total cost of ownership(TCO) increased security, reduced cost and downtime and centralized management.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sofiware/Application Virtualization</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>It refers to the process of placing an application on a central server and that application can be run virtually on many platforms. The virtualization program behaves precisely like a native program installed on a real workstation for end users. eg: Docker</li>
<li>It makes it easier for enterprise to ntrool update, manage and repair applications . Admin may alter and control program access rights without signing into the the users desktop</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data Virtualization:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>it invovels creating a unfied view of data from multiple sources, such as databases, files, or web services , without physically moving or copying the data</li>
<li>It provides a larger of abstraction that allows application to access and muniplate data from different sources as if it were in a single location</li>
<li>Ex : Denodo,oralle data virtuaication</li>
<li>Advantages : Easy data integration and access , reduce data duplication and redundancy, relatime data access and analyst.</li>

<p> </p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Cloud adoption refers to the process of an organization moving its data, applications, and other business processes to a cloud computing environment. This transition involves using cloud services, which can include public, private, or hybrid cloud models, to gain various business benefits. Cloud adoption can be partial (where only certain applications or services are moved to the cloud) or complete (where an organization’s entire IT infrastructure is migrated to the cloud).<br />
Several factors lead organizations to adopt cloud computing. Some of them are:</p>
<p>1.<strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong><br />
Cloud computing operates on a pay-as-you-go model. This reduces the need for large<br />
investments. They also often come with lower operational costs due to reduced requirements for in-house IT maintenance and management.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Scalability and Flexibility</strong>:<br />
Cloud platforms provide the ability to scale resources up or down based on demand, ensuring<br />
that organizations can handle peak loads without any downtimes.</p>
<p>3.<strong> Performance and Reliability</strong>:<br />
Cloud providers typically offer robust disaster recovery solutions and ensure high availability<br />
through various data centers.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Security</strong>:<br />
Cloud providers invest heavily in security technologies and offer features such as data encryption, identity and access management, and compliance certifications. They are regularly updated with the latest security patches and updates, reducing vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Isolation</strong>:<br />
VMs are isolated from each other, which enhances security and stability. If one VM experiences issues or a security breach, it does not affect other VMs on the same physical host.</p>

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>Describe how cloud computing technology can be applied to support remote ECG monitoring as part of scientific application?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>The ECG machine is a health monitoring device that measures the human body&#8217;s heartbeat and prints the results on graph paper. The ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart&#8217;s Cardium. A waveform is created as a result of this action, which is repeated throughout time and symbolizes the heartbeat. The analysis of the shape is used to identify arrhythmias, and it is the most common way of detecting heart diseases.</p>

<p>Cloud computing technology can significantly enhance remote ECG monitoring, making it more efficient, scalable, and accessible. By using cloud capabilities, healthcare providers can monitor patients&#8217; heart conditions remotely in real-time, leading to better diagnosis and continuous monitoring. This way, the patient at risk can be constantly monitored without going to the hospital for ECG analysis. At the same time, the Doctors can instantly be notified of cases that need their attention.<br />
In this figure, there are different types of computing devices equipped with ECG sensors to constantly monitor the patient&#8217;s heartbeat. The respective information is transmitted to the patient&#8217;s mobile device that will immediately be forwarded to the cloud-hosted web services for<br />
analysis. Results are visualized on dashboards accessible to healthcare providers. Doctors can access and review the data remotely, providing timely intervention if needed. In this way, cloud computing technology can be utilized in ECG monitoring.</p>
