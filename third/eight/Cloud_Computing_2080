<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What is thread? Why multi-threading is used ? Describe how thread programming is done in cloud .</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an operating system. It is a sequence of executable instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically part of the operating system. Threads are used to divide a program into multiple, concurrently running tasks.</p>
<p>Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism by dividing a program into multiple concurrent threads. The key benefits include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Increased Responsiveness</em></span> :  Multithreading can help maintain the responsiveness of an application. For instance, a program can continue to be responsive to user inputs while performing background tasks.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Resource Sharing </em></span>: Threads within the same process share memory and resources, which can lead to more efficient utilization of resources compared to using multiple processes.</li>
<li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Performance </span></em>: Multithreading can improve the performance of applications, especially on multi-core processors, by allowing multiple operations to be executed simultaneously.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Simplified Code Structure</em></span> : In some cases, using threads can lead to a cleaner and more maintainable code structure by isolating concurrent operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thread programming involves creating and managing multiple threads within a program to achieve concurrent execution of tasks . In general thread programming is done as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Thread Creation</em></span> : Thread are typically created by the operating system or a thread management library provided by the programming language.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Thread Synchronization</em></span> : Thread access shared resources, so thread synchronization mechanisms are required to prevent conflicts and ensure data integrity. Common synchronixation techniques include locks, mutex, semaphores and condition variables.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Thread Execution</em></span> : The schedular determines the order and duration of execution for each thread based on fcators such as priority, time slicing and the availability of resources.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Thread Communication</em></span> : This can achieve through mechanisms such as shared memory message passing etc.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Thread Termination</em></span> : Threads can be terminated explicitly by the program or automatically by the operating system when they have completed their tasks.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Discuss different implementation levels of virtualization. What are the benefits of virtualization?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Virtualization is a technology in cloud computing that involves creating virtual versions of physical resources such as servers, storage devices, networks, and even entire computing environments. The primary benefits of virtualization in cloud computing:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Resource Optimization</span></em> : Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine, maximizing the utilization of physical resources and reducing hardware costs.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Flexibility</em></span> : Resources can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, providing flexibility and efficient use of infrastructure.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Cost Savings</em> </span>: By consolidating multiple workloads onto fewer physical machines, organizations can significantly reduce the need for physical hardware.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Simplified Management</em></span> : Virtual environments can be managed from a single console, simplifying administration and reducing the complexity of managing multiple physical servers.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Enhanced Security and Isolation</em></span> : Virtual machines are isolated from each other, meaning  that if one VM is compromised, the others remain unaffected, enhancing overall security.</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementation Level of Virtualization Structures</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37069 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/implementation-of-virtualization.drawio.png?resize=468%2C301&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="468" height="301"></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">fig : Level of Virtualization</p>
<p>1. <strong>Instruction set architecture(ISA) Level</strong> :</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>Virtualization is ISA level is achieved by ISA emulation.</li>
<li>This  is useful for running large amounts of legacy code that was originally develope for various hardware configuration.</li>
<li>These programs can be executed on the virtual machine through an ISAA binary code. They can be executed on X86 or even on an X64 computer.</li>
<li>ISA contributes to this VM,S hardware independence.</li>
</ul>
<p>2.<strong> Hardware Abstraction Level (HAL)</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Hardware level virtualization occours directly on the top of hardware. It creates a virtual machine as well as handles the underlying hardware through virtualization.</li>
<li>The goal is to virtualize the resources of the computer, such as its processor , memory, and I/O device and allows several users to enhance the hardware usage rate at the same time.</li>
<li>Recently Xen hypervisor has been used to virtualize X86 based workstations to run linux or other guest OS.</li>
</ul>
<p>3.<strong> Operating System level</strong> :</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Virtualization at this level establishes an abstract lays between the programs and the os</li>
<li>It functions as a separaete contanier on the actual server os, utlilizing hardware and software</li>
<li>To allocate hardware resources to muliple users, os-leous virtulization is often used . Every user gets their virtual environment with their virtual environment with their virtual hardware resources</li>
</ul>
<p>4. <strong>Library level</strong> :</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>At this level , the applications . make use of the API that is form the libranies at a user level</li>
<li>It is achived by  API hooks to regulate the communication channel between the programs of the rest of the system</li>
<li>This concept has been applied by the software utilty WINE to support windows programs on top of UNIX host.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. <strong>Application level</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>When you simply want to virtualize a single program, application level virtualization neds to be considered. In this case, the entire environment of the platform does not need to be virtualized.</li>
<li>As application run as a single process on a computer&#8217;s OS this can also be reffered to as process level voirtualization.</li>
<li>It is benefitial when VMs employ high level language. Ex: Micosoft.NET , Juff etc.</li>
<li>The application will sit above the virtualization layer which in turn sits on the application program.</li>
</ul>
