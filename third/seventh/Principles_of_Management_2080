    <h2>Group A: Attempt any THREE questions</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>Define organizational goals. How are organizational goals formulated?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><h3>Organizational Goals</h3>
<p>Organizational goals are the expected outcomes from the activities performed within an organization. They represent the reasons for the organization&#8217;s existence and provide a desired destination that the organization aims to reach. Goals give the organization direction, helping focus activities toward achieving specific objectives. They are integral in guiding decision-making processes and ensuring that efforts are aligned with the organization&#8217;s overall mission.</p>
<h3>Approaches to Goal Formulation</h3>
<p>There are three main approaches to goal formulation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Top-Down Approach</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>top-down approach</strong> is directive in nature. In this method, top executives first develop the corporate goals, which are then disseminated to middle and lower-level managers for implementation. Top-level managers rely on their knowledge and experience to formulate these goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Bottom-Up Approach</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The <strong>bottom-up approach</strong> is participatory. In this approach, functional workers at lower levels formulate goals for their specific positions and then pass them to top-level management for final revision and approval. Top management finalizes the goals based on the organization&#8217;s mission statement and then disseminates them for implementation at lower levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Management by Objectives (MBO)</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>MBO</strong>, proposed by Peter Drucker in 1960, involves both top-level and lower-level management jointly formulating organizational goals. This approach focuses on determining each individual&#8217;s major area of responsibility in terms of goals, giving employees a sense of ownership and motivating them. The collaborative effort between managers and subordinates in the goal-setting process is the major advantage of MBO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Goal Formation Process</h3>
<p>The process of goal formulation typically involves several key steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Assigning a Group</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Initially, a group is formed, involving managers from all levels (top, middle, and lower). The involvement of higher-level managers ensures the utilization of their expertise regarding environmental changes and resource allocation. Meanwhile, the participation of lower-level managers ensures that the goals are realistic, achievable, and that there is commitment towards their accomplishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Scanning</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The next step involves gathering and analyzing relevant information about the internal and external environment. This helps to identify political, technological, and socio-cultural changes and understand their possible impacts on the organization. It also includes assessing the organization’s strengths and weaknesses, which can help capitalize on opportunities and address potential threats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Determining and Listing Potential Goals</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After analyzing the environmental factors, potential goals are formulated and listed. These goals should align with the organization’s mission and the opportunities identified in the environmental scan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming on Potential Goals</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Once the potential goals are identified, it is necessary to carefully evaluate each goal. Managers engage in discussions to assess the relevance, strengths, weaknesses, and future success potential of each goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reaching a Consensus</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After thoughtful discussion, the best goal from the list is chosen. There must be a consensus among the majority regarding the goal selection. This helps avoid conflicts and ensures motivation among workers to achieve the chosen goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Determining the Major Areas of Responsibility</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>After finalizing the goal, managers determine the specific activities required to achieve it. Additionally, the authority-responsibility relationship for each activity is outlined, and tasks are assigned to individuals based on their areas of responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Management is the art and science of organizing and directing human efforts applied to control the forces and utilize the materials of nature for the benefit of human beings. It involves planning, organizing, staffing, leading, and controlling an organization&#8217;s operations to achieve predefined objectives.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Principles of Management:</span></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Division of Work</strong>: Specialization allows individuals to build up expertise in specific areas, enhancing efficiency and productivity. This principle suggests that workers should perform tasks where they have specialized skills.</li>
<li><strong>Authority and Responsibility</strong>: These two elements must balance each other. People who are given authority to act should also carry the responsibility for their actions, ensuring accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Discipline</strong>: Discipline within an organization is essential for smooth operations. It involves employees adhering to company rules and following directives, fostering a stable working environment.</li>
<li><strong>Unity of Command</strong>: Employees should receive orders from only one supervisor at a time, avoiding conflicting instructions and ensuring clear accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Fair Remuneration</strong>: Compensation should be fair and satisfactory to both employees and the organization. This encourages motivation and maintains harmony within the workforce.</li>
<li><strong>Centralization and Decentralization</strong>: There should be a balance between centralized and decentralized management, depending on the organization&#8217;s size and the nature of its operations. The right balance helps in effective decision-making and optimizing managerial control.</li>
<li><strong>Scalar Chain</strong>: A clear line of authority from top management to the lowest ranks is crucial. It facilitates proper communication and authority within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Order</strong>: There should be a place for everything and everyone within the organization. Proper organization of physical and human resources optimizes efficiency and productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Equality</strong>: Equal treatment should be given to all employees, regardless of their background. Fair and impartial treatment is key to maintaining moral and ethical standards.</li>
<li><strong>Spirit of Cooperation</strong>: Promoting teamwork and cooperation among staff enhances productivity and morale. Collective effort is essential for achieving organizational goals, requiring everyone to work harmoniously towards shared objectives</li>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What is planning? Discuss the major steps involved in the planning process.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is a primary management function concerned with the determination of objectives and their best achievement. The organization must decide, among other things, what needs to be done, when, how, and by whom in order for success to be achieved. It literally involves thinking ahead in directing the organization to achieve the goal set for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The steps involved in planning are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Defining Mission and Goals</strong><br />
The planning process begins with understanding the organization&#8217;s mission and goals. The mission and goals provide direction for the organization&#8217;s course of action, ensuring that it stays within the boundaries of its stated mission and guarantees its continued existence. For effective planning, it is crucial that the mission and goals are clearly defined.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Environmental Forces</strong><br />
Environmental forces, both external and internal, directly and indirectly affect the functioning of an organization. Planning and strategy development require a thorough analysis of these forces. Management must understand the current state of these forces and have a clear understanding of their potential future direction.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Opportunities and Threats</strong><br />
External environmental forces create both opportunities and threats for the organization. Identifying these opportunities and threats is a critical step in the planning process. The plan should aim to capitalize on opportunities while neutralizing or mitigating potential threats.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze Organizational Resources</strong><br />
Organizational resources include the company&#8217;s abilities, competencies, information, and other resources necessary for improving performance. Optimal allocation of these resources enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. Thus, these resources should be carefully determined and analyzed during the planning process.</li>
<li><strong>Formulation of Plans</strong><br />
After the previous steps are completed, a draft for future activities is developed, which involves formulating a comprehensive and integrated plan. These plans should cover all levels of management and their respective functions.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation of Plans</strong><br />
Once the plans are formulated, the next step is their implementation. During implementation, managers ensure that the necessary resources are available and used effectively and efficiently. Additionally, motivating people to complete planned activities within the set timeframe is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluation and Control</strong><br />
The final step in the planning process is monitoring the progress of implementation. Regular evaluations allow management to understand any deviations and their causes. A feedback system helps initiate timely actions and adjustments to the plan when needed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">State and explain the major problems facing business in Nepal. </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">The major problems facing business in Nepal are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Policy related problems:</strong> Fiscal and industrial policy is indispensable to motivate business, yet in Nepal, they have mostly been ambiguous and not friendly to business. These policies are ambiguous, at times conflicting, and are changed very frequently, especially the tax provisions. Besides, starting a business in Nepal is one of the lengthiest and most time-consuming processes in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Capital and technology-related problems:</strong> Nepalese firms face an inadequate supply of capital with technological backwardness. Access to loans is made cumbersome with lots of formalities, paper work, high-interest rates, etc. This discourages expansion. Long payback periods of projects amid political and economic instability make profit generation difficult for firms. It increases costs of production with outdated technology; many organizations are also backward in quality management and product consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure related problems:</strong> Road, electricity, transportation, communication, etc. are most important infrastructures for success of business. Poor infrastructutal facility increases the cost of transportation and procurement. In Nepal such infrastructures are in poor condition. So, infrastructure related problems are other important business problems in Nepal.</li>
<li><strong>Those pertaining to labor:</strong> The industry faces a rise in the menace of labor problems since democracy was restored in Nepal. Strong labor unions, influenced by political parties, put the needs of the party ahead of the organization&#8217;s requirements. This makes hiring and managing employees difficult. Workers, therefore, work less for the success of the organization. This has a very adverse impact on business processes.</li>
<li><strong>Problems related to raw materials:</strong> For production-based businesses, raw materials are highly needed to meet customer demands. The business enterprises depend on either foreign suppliers with low quality and higher prices or domestic sources with outdated technology in Nepal. Furthermore, the raw materials may not be available when needed, which affects business enterprise growth and improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Politics-related problems:</strong> Political ideology shapes the economic, fiscal, and industrial policies of the country, which must be explicit, stable, and business-friendly. In this regard, political stability is a must. However, in Nepal, politics has been turbulent for a long time, due to which businesses cannot make long-term strategies and plans that essentially assure their success.</li>
<li><strong>Demand-related problems:</strong> Nepalese markets are smaller compared to the neighboring markets, and demands are unpredictable. Therefore, companies cannot estimate the sales in advance. Besides that, people&#8217;s purchasing power is too low. Low purchasing power increases the cost of production and makes the products uncompetitive. It is also necessary for the business enterprises to export goods with value addition to a foreign market.</li>
<li><strong>Mutual trust-related problems:</strong> For smooth business establishment or success, good relationships and mutual trust are crucial among management, the government, and employees. Companies do not generally trust the government and employee unions, and vice-versa, in Nepal. The government suspects companies of tax evasion, while on the other hand, labor unions formulate policies against the management. This leads to a lack of mutual trust among these three parties, which is harmful for business success.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Group B: Attempt any TEN questions</h2><h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>What is learning organization? Explain the benefits of learning.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">A learning organization is one that encourages the creation of new knowledge and methods to solve problems. In today’s competitive market, knowledge is key to success. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to focus on learning new techniques to stay competitive. Knowledge isn&#8217;t limited by age, gender, or position within the organization. The concept is based on the understanding that successful adaptation to a rapidly changing environment is key to an organization&#8217;s long-term survival and competitiveness.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of learning  are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Adaptability and Flexibility</strong>: Continuous learning allows individuals to adapt to new situations and challenges effectively, making it easier to adjust to changes in their personal and professional lives.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Innovation</strong>: Learning fuels creativity and innovation by exposing individuals to new ideas and methods, which can lead to innovative solutions in various aspects of life.</li>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>Write the approaches of social responsibility.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">The approaches of social responsibility are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Social Obstruction Approach</strong>: The social obstruction approach to social responsibility deals with managers who feel businesses have no reason, whatsoever, to deal with problems in society or the environment. To them, it is a waste of resources; besides, companies cannot possibly solve such issues. Because of this orientation, such firms often cross legal or ethical boundaries, and instead of taking corrective measures, they engage in denial or cover-up activities in relation to legal issues.</li>
<li><strong>Social Obligation Approach</strong>: The social obligation approach is a step beyond social obstruction in social responsibility. It holds that an organization should do only what the law or regulations require and nothing more. Managers of this perspective aim solely at generating profits with little or no social contribution, just sufficient not to be characterized as unethical.</li>
<li><strong>Social Response Approach</strong>: A firm that pursues the social response approach fulfills both its legal and ethical requirements, but only in particular instances. Such a company may participate in some selected social programs but needs persuasion to be satisfied that the program they are being asked to support is worthy of its investment. It&#8217;s more about demonstrating to show that the organization is giving back to society than doing it as a habitual practice.</li>
<li><strong>Social Contribution Approach</strong>: This is the highest level of social responsibility the firm can adopt. Organizations adopting this approach view themselves as active members of society and are continually looking for ways in which they can contribute. They believe that social responsibility is an investment in their future and they will go all the way to make significant contributions to social welfare.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Mention the types of problems on the basis of urgency.</span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The types of problems on the basis of urgency are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Urgent problems:</strong> If the problems need to be solved very quickly, such problems are called urgent problems. Defects in machinery, imports of raw materials, absenteeism of employees, and high turnover ratio of employees need to be solved immediately. Such problems are urgent problems.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Urgent problems:</strong> If the problems are not urgent to solve then the problems are called non-urgent problems. For such problems, managers may delay to find the solutions. They may call several meetings with superiors and subordinates, may get the advice of experts, and may consult with legal adviser before coming to the conclusion. Problems regarding goals, objectives, or some legal procurement are related with this category.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">What type of organization formed departmentalization by customers? </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">Departmentation is a process of gathering similar functions together into manageable units for the effective coordination of resources within an organization. Large and complex tasks are cut down into smaller, flexible units for the completion of work efficiently. It enhances the structure of communication, coordination, and control within an organization to achieve goals on time.</p>
<p>In other words, departmentation splits responsibilities into functional areas to encourage specialization. It creates autonomous departments that have a specific set of activities; enabling employees to utilize their experience and skills effectively. All this helps in generating accountability as well, wherein the managers and subordinates come together to avoid duplication and overlapping in efforts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The organizations that cater to different groups of customers with unique needs usually use departmentalization by customers. Under this, departments are divided based on the customer type. This enables an organization to customize its products or services according to the unique demands of each group. Examples include</p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Retail Chains: Divisions for individual customers, corporate clients, or wholesale buyers.</li>
<li>Banks: Separate departments for personal banking, business banking, and corporate banking.</li>
<li>Healthcare Providers: Departments for children, adults, and senior citizens.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This approach helps organizations deliver specialized services and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>Introduce conflict. Explain the types of conflict.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Conflict</strong> is a situation of disagreement between different parties. <strong>Organizational conflict</strong> is disagreement that occurs because of incompatibility between individuals or groups working together. It tends to take root from differences in ideas, goals, needs, or interests. Conflicts can occur either due to actual issues or perceived differences.</p>
<p>Conflicts in workplaces can occur due to differences of opinion concerning specific tasks, decisions, or priorities. Such disagreement can lead to tension and hinder cooperation at work unless properly handled. Organizational conflict is a natural consequence of the different perspectives and interests in a team or organization.</p>
<p><strong>The types of conflict are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Classification of conflict based on involvement</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><strong>Intrapersonal Conflict</strong>: Occurs within a person when the different roles or options come into conflict. This mostly happens when an individual faces a decision between two alternatives, both equally desirable or undesirable, causing confusion about priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Intra-team Conflict</strong>: Refers to conflict within a single team. It can arise from disagreements on tasks, priorities, or the use of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-team Conflict</strong>: Refers to conflict between two different teams in an organization. Often arises from competition for resources, priority, or management policies.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-organizational Conflict</strong>: Occurs between different organizations. Typically arises due to competition for resources, having different priorities, or conflicting management policies.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Classification of conflict based on the reason for conflict</strong>:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><strong>Relationship Conflict</strong>: Arises from interpersonal differences and tensions, either at the same or different levels within an organization. It emphasizes personal relationships over work-related tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Task Conflict</strong>: Occurs when there is disagreement among team members about the nature of the work to be performed. This type of conflict can stem from ambiguity over roles, delegation of duties, or work priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Process Conflict</strong>: Arises over how a task should be completed. It involves differences in opinion about work processes, priorities, or procedures. This could be between managers over steps to follow or between supervisors and employees on how to accomplish a task.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<div><p><p>Define <span lang="EN-US">motivation. Explain Herzberg’s theory of motivation.</span></p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Motivation is the reason or drive behind doing something. It’s the force that pushes someone to take action to achieve a goal, complete a task, or improve themselves. Motivation can be <strong>intrinsic</strong>, where the drive to succeed comes from within the individual, or <strong>extrinsic</strong>, where the drive is fueled by external rewards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Herzberg&#8217;s theory, also known as the <strong>Two-Factor Theory</strong>, there are two categories of factors that influence work motivation:</p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Hygiene Factors:</strong> These are the basic things that need to be in place to prevent dissatisfaction, but they don’t necessarily motivate people. Examples include salary, job security, working conditions, and company policies. If these factors are not good, people will be unhappy, but improving them doesn’t necessarily lead to higher motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfiers /Motivators:</strong> These are the factors that can increase satisfaction and motivation. Examples include recognition, the nature of the work itself, growth opportunities, and achievements. When these factors are present, employees feel more motivated to perform at their best.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Herzberg’s theory says that to avoid dissatisfaction, you need to get the basics right. However, true motivation comes from the elements that make work meaningful and fulfilling.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Explain the essentials of effective reward systems. </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>The Reward System</strong> refers to both formal and informal methods used to evaluate and reward employees&#8217; performance. It consists of rules, procedures, and standards that determine how benefits and compensation are given to employees. A well-structured reward system has a positive impact on employees, increasing their motivation and ultimately improving their productivity and performance. For a reward system to be effective, it must be reliable, transparent, financially feasible, unbiased, and fairly aligned with the value and contribution of the employee.</p>
<p><strong>The essentials of an effective reward system are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Fairness and Equity</strong>: The reward system must be fair and transparent, ensuring that employees feel they are rewarded based on their performance, contributions, and qualifications, without bias. It should promote a sense of equality within the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity</strong>: The criteria for earning rewards should be clear and well-defined, so employees understand what they need to do to achieve rewards. This includes setting measurable goals and performance standards.</li>
<li><strong>Timeliness</strong>: Rewards should be given in a timely manner, close to the performance or achievement. Immediate recognition of effort or results helps reinforce positive behavior and boosts morale.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Organizational Goals</strong>: The reward system should be aligned with the organization’s goals and values. It should encourage behaviors and achievements that contribute directly to the success of the company.</li>
<li><strong>Motivational</strong>: Rewards should be designed to motivate employees to perform at their best. This can include a mix of intrinsic rewards (e.g., personal growth, job satisfaction) and extrinsic rewards (e.g., salary, bonuses, recognition).</li>
<li><strong>Competitive</strong>: The reward system should be competitive within the industry. Organizations need to ensure that their rewards are attractive enough to retain top talent and stay ahead in the job market.</li>
<li><strong>Employee Involvement</strong>: Involving employees in the design of the reward system can help ensure it is effective. When employees feel they have a say in how they are rewarded, they are more likely to feel valued and motivated.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>Mention about formal and informal communication.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Formal Communication</strong> refers to communication that follows the official channels in an organization&#8217;s structure. Controlled by top management, it can include instructions, plans, policies, feedback, and complaints. Formal communication can be broken down into four types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Downward Communication</strong>: This type flows from higher levels (like managers or top-level executives) down to subordinates. It includes instructions, policies, procedures, and updates on strategies or goals.</li>
<li><strong>Upward Communication</strong>: This is communication that flows from subordinates to higher levels of management. It typically includes progress reports, suggestions, feedback, and any concerns or grievances.</li>
<li><strong>Horizontal Communication</strong>: This happens between employees or departments at the same level within the organization. It helps share information and coordinate activities among peers or teams.</li>
<li><strong>Diagonal Communication</strong>: This occurs between different departments and hierarchical levels. For example, a manager from one department might communicate with a supervisor from another department to share information.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Informal Communication</strong> happens outside the official communication channels and is not controlled by management. It arises from social interactions, relationships, and friendships among employees. Unlike formal communication, it doesn&#8217;t follow the chain of command. Informal communication is often effective for personal conversations but can be less reliable as it is not officially verified. Common forms include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Grapevine</strong>: This is an informal, unstructured way of communication where information flows freely among employees. It has no set path and can spread quickly through networks like gossip, chains, or clusters.</li>
<li><strong>Rumors</strong>: These are unverified stories or opinions that spread quickly, often during times of uncertainty or crisis. Rumors can cause confusion or fear, so managers must provide accurate information to prevent them from influencing decision-making.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Describe the different types of control system. </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>The types of control systems are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Pre-control (Feed-forward Control)</strong>: This type of control happens before activities begin. It involves planning and thinking ahead to prevent problems. Pre-control uses feedback from past performance or experience to guide decisions and actions. It helps ensure that activities are on track from the start and that resources are used effectively. It&#8217;s a proactive measure to avoid deviations from goals.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent Control</strong>: This control happens during the ongoing activities. It&#8217;s about monitoring in real-time, identifying issues as they arise, and making immediate corrections. It&#8217;s like adjusting your actions while you&#8217;re doing them, such as a driver adjusting the steering wheel based on obstacles or direction. Examples include quality control in factories or inventory management.</li>
<li><strong>Post-control (Feedback Control)</strong>: This control happens after the activity is completed. It focuses on evaluating performance to gather insights for future improvements. It helps managers adjust strategies and systems for future projects based on the feedback from the completed activity. Examples include performance evaluations, customer satisfaction surveys, and financial statement analysis.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<div><p><p>Write any four negative effects of globalization.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Globalization</strong> refers to the integration of economies and societies worldwide. It involves exchanges in technology, economics, politics, and culture, made possible by advancements in communication, transportation, and infrastructure. Simply put, globalization is the increasing international interaction of markets for goods, services, capital, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>The four negative effects of globalization are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Loss of Domestic Firms</strong>: Smaller domestic companies often lack the resources, like capital and technology, to compete with large multinational corporations. These domestic firms can&#8217;t match the quality or price of the global giants, leading to a gradual loss of market share and, in some cases, their closure. For example, many Nepali aluminum industries have shut down, and the Nepali garment industry is struggling due to globalization.</li>
<li><strong>Eroding of National Sovereignty</strong>: Globalization can undermine national sovereignty as developing countries are often pressured to adopt policies that favor multinational companies in exchange for grants, loans, or foreign direct investment (FDI). These companies and their home countries may influence the policies of host nations to benefit their interests.</li>
<li><strong>Threat to Social and Cultural Values</strong>: Globalization can harm local cultures and social values as imported cultural norms from developed countries take hold. This shift can lead to changes in lifestyle, sometimes causing socially undesirable behaviors and eroding indigenous customs and traditions.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Degradation</strong>: Globalization contributes to environmental problems like global warming, ozone layer depletion, and biodiversity loss. The rapid expansion of multinational companies has led to increased pollution in major cities, including water, air, soil, and noise pollution, while overconsumption of natural resources is putting further strain on the planet.</li>
