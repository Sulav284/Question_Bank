    <h2> GROUP A: Answer any THREE questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>Discuss the challenging perspectives of organization in present business operation.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>In the current business landscape, organizations face a lot of challenges that require adaptive strategies and innovative management practices. The evolving perspectives of organizations in today’s dynamic environment are influenced by various factors that challenge traditional paradigms and definitely require a reconsideration of how organizations operate. Here is an exploration of some key challenging perspectives:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Open System Perspective</strong>: In the 21st century, organizations are viewed not as closed systems but as open systems that must interact actively with their environments. This shift means that organizations cannot operate in isolation but must continuously adapt to external forces, such as market trends, regulatory changes, and technological advancements. Feedback from the environment is crucial as it helps organizations adjust their strategies and operations to better suit external demands and opportunities. This continuous interaction and adaptation are critical for sustaining competitive advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Organization as Culture</strong>: Today’s organizations are also seen as cultures—a sum of values, traditions, beliefs, and assumptions. This perspective emphasizes the importance of a strong and adaptable organizational culture in navigating the complexities of global business. Disputes and misunderstandings can often be mitigated through a well-developed organizational culture that promotes mutual respect and shared values. As organizations expand globally, the challenge becomes how to integrate diverse cultural perspectives and maintain a cohesive organizational culture that aligns with the company’s goals and ethical standards.</li>
<li><strong>Globalization</strong>: The movement of goods, services, and capital across the world has turned organizations into global players, which brings both opportunities and challenges. Globalization compels organizations to operate in a global market, competing not just with local businesses but with companies around the world. Managers must be particularly innovative and flexible, adapting their strategies to fit not only local but also global market conditions. This often involves making significant adjustments to business models, operational strategies, and marketing approaches to ensure relevance and competitiveness on a global scale.</li>
<li><strong>Learning System</strong>: With the rapid pace of technological change, organizations must adopt a learning system approach. This involves accumulating knowledge continuously and integrating innovation into every aspect of business operations. Managers must facilitate an environment where creativity and innovation are at the forefront, allowing the organization to adapt to new technologies and market demands swiftly. This also involves embracing change rather than adhering to traditional methods that may no longer be effective.</li>
<li><strong>Temporary Employment and Human Resource Management</strong>: The rise of gig and contract work has transformed traditional employment relationships. Organizations are increasingly relying on temporary or contract workers, which poses challenges in terms of human resource management and employee loyalty. Moreover, the workforce has become more diverse than ever, encompassing varying ages, ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds. Managing such diversity requires inclusive policies and practices that not only address but capitalize on the strengths of a diverse workforce.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Advancements</strong>: Every organization today needs to be on the cutting edge of technological adoption. This means not only incorporating new technologies into existing processes but also being prepared to overhaul entire systems. For many businesses, this might mean digital transformations that integrate advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Workforce Diversity</strong>: Managing a diverse workforce is increasingly important in today&#8217;s global business environment. Organizations must navigate the complexities of a workforce that varies widely in age, gender, race, cultural background, and professional experience. Embracing diversity not only helps in enhancing innovation and creativity but also in understanding and penetrating diverse markets more effectively. However, it poses challenges in terms of integrating diverse perspectives, preventing discrimination, and promoting inclusivity.</li>
<li><strong>Team Empowerment</strong>: Empowering teams within an organization can lead to more effective problem-solving and innovation. Team empowerment involves granting team members autonomy to make decisions, plan, and control their work. This approach can increase motivation and improve job satisfaction, but it also requires strong coordination and clear communication of organizational goals to prevent misalignment. Managers need to ensure that empowered teams have the necessary resources and knowledge to function effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Work Time Flexibility</strong>: Flexible working hours are becoming a norm, especially with the rise of remote work technologies. Organizations that offer flexibility in work hours often see improvements in employee satisfaction and productivity. However, this approach challenges traditional management practices, requiring new systems for tracking performance and ensuring productivity. It also demands a higher level of trust between employees and management, and a shift from presenteeism to a focus on outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Participative Culture</strong>: Cultivating a participative culture where employees are actively involved in decision-making processes can enhance commitment and improve organizational outcomes. This model encourages feedback and insights from all levels of the organization, leveraging the collective intelligence of the workforce. However, implementing such a culture requires transparent communication channels and may slow down decision-making processes due to the increased number of stakeholders involved.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the emerging business environment in Nepal.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">The industrial sector acts as the base for national development. The good achievements of economic and social targets are possible only when the resources such as natural materials, money, and skill are properly utilized. Industries accelerate technological development and create job opportunities, thereby increasing the standard of living. Consequently, this sector enhances personal betterment, social felicity, national self-esteem, and a rise in economic growth.</p>
<p>The history of Nepal&#8217;s industrial and business sectors is relatively short. With the establishment of the Udyog Parisad in 1935 AD and the Company Act in 1937 AD, the path was provided for banking, industry, and commerce. Biratnagar Jute Mill, established in 1936 AD, marked the beginning of large-scale industry. Later on, the establishment of the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation in 1959 AD and the Industrial Enterprises Act in 1961 AD attracted more industries. It was later amended in 1974 AD and replaced by Industrial Policy to promote further development.</p>
<p>After 1990 AD, the global and national business scenario significantly changed. Democracy was restored in Nepal, and the government offered the liberalized Industrial Policy of 1992. More emphasis was given to the promotion of the private sector rather than the public sector. Prior to 1990, more than 60 public enterprises existed, but their numbers gradually declined after liberalization. Simultaneously, private sector industries boomed through many sectors such as hotels, transportation, healthcare, education, and manufacturing, including cement, bricks, construction, and diary products.</p>
<p>Nepal&#8217;s pharmaceutical industry today covers around 50% of the country&#8217;s medicine requirements. Similarly, the cement industry meets 55% of national demand, and soap industries meet almost 100% of the need. Nepal is also becoming self-dependent in poultry and fishery products, while iron industries are also meeting almost the entire national demand. However, dependence on intermediaries, lack of skilled manpower, old equipment, dependence on weather, poor market management, and unorganized sectors lead to deterioration in agricultural performances.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture remains the main sector in Nepal&#8217;s economy, with a share of over 70 percent of the population and contributing 33 percent to GDP. However, the economy is finally shifting towards the service sector, which includes tourism, hotels, banking, and hydroelectricity. The pace of growth lately has been quite steady, though weak governmental institutions, increased population, and social instability keeps it at bay.</p>
<p>From 2008/09 to 2018/19, financial intermediaries contribution increased from 4.16% to 6.32%, and real estate, renting, and business activities from 8.69% to 11.57%. Contribution of hotels and restaurants also increased, though on a slow pace. In return, industrial sectors contribution decreased from 6.97% to 5.59% and agriculture from 32.54% to 26.50%. Transportation, communication, and storage sectors are being refused, while the contribution of the education sector is increasing.</p>

<li>The process can be time-consuming.</li>
<li>Requires training for effective implementation.</li>
<li>Potential for overlapping responsibilities without clear roles.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>What is motivation? Explain Maslow’s need hierarchy theory of motivation.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">Motivation is the reason or drive behind doing something. It’s the force that pushes someone to take action to achieve a goal, complete a task, or improve themselves. Motivation can be <strong>intrinsic</strong>, where the drive to succeed comes from within the individual, or <strong>extrinsic</strong>, where the drive is fueled by external rewards.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Herzberg&#8217;s theory, also known as the <strong>Two-Factor Theory</strong>, there are two categories of factors that influence work motivation:</p>
<ol style="font-weight: 400;">
<li><strong>Hygiene Factors:</strong> These are the basic things that need to be in place to prevent dissatisfaction, but they don’t necessarily motivate people. Examples include salary, job security, working conditions, and company policies. If these factors are not good, people will be unhappy, but improving them doesn’t necessarily lead to higher motivation.</li>
<li><strong>Satisfiers / Motivators:</strong> These are the factors that can increase satisfaction and motivation. Examples include recognition, the nature of the work itself, growth opportunities, and achievements. When these factors are present, employees feel more motivated to perform at their best.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In short, Herzberg’s theory says that to avoid dissatisfaction, you need to get the basics right. However, true motivation comes from the elements that make work meaningful and fulfilling.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Define business ethics. Explain their significance. </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>According to Andrew Crane, &#8220;Business ethics is the study of business situations, activities, and decisions where issues of right and wrong are addressed.&#8221; This definition highlights the importance of adhering to ethical practices in business operations, emphasizing the distinction between correct and false activities within business organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Significance of Business Ethics</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Prevents Malpractices</strong>: Business ethics play a crucial role in preventing business malpractices such as unfair trade practices, black-marketing, unnatural price hiking, adulteration, cheating in weights and measures, selling low-quality and harmful products, and making false commitments. Ethical standards ensure that businesses act responsibly, benefiting consumers and society as a whole.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Confidence</strong>: Ethics in business boosts customer confidence. When companies adhere to ethical standards, customers can make purchase decisions with greater assurance, knowing that products and services meet expectations in terms of quality, utility, reliability, quantity, and price. This trust enhances consumer satisfaction and loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>Business Survival and Growth</strong>: Ethical behavior is fundamental to the survival and growth of a business. Organizations that maintain ethical practices gain and retain the trust of their customers. Ethical lapses can significantly damage a company&#8217;s reputation and its ability to regain consumer trust. Consequently, maintaining high ethical standards is essential for long-term success and customer loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>Protection of Consumer Rights</strong>: Business ethics safeguard consumer rights, including the right to information, choice, safety, and compensation. By protecting these rights, businesses demonstrate their commitment to social responsibility, which in turn opens up more opportunities for the business.</li>
<li><strong>Builds Good Relationships</strong>: Ethical practices foster fair treatment of customers and business partners, leading to positive relationships within the business community and with consumers. These relationships are beneficial not only to the business&#8217;s status but also to sustainable growth and improvements in the living standards of society.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">State the types of decisions.</span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Types of Decisions in Organizations</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Decisions in an organization can vary significantly based on their nature, frequency, and the level of collaboration involved. Here’s a breakdown of the types of decisions based on these factors:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Based on Frequency of Recurrence:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Programmed Decisions</strong>: These are routine decisions for repetitive problems where the response is predetermined based on established procedures. Typically managed by middle and lower-level managers, these decisions are quick, predictable, and generally have a short-term impact.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Non-Programmed Decisions</strong>: Made for unique and infrequent problems, these decisions are complex and require creativity, careful thought, and judgment. They are usually handled by top-level management and often relate to long-term strategies, organizational goals, or exceptional issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. On the Basis of the Nature of Decisions:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Strategic Decisions</strong>: Made by top-level management, these decisions are intended for long-term impacts and involve setting long-term goals, objectives, and strategic plans.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Tactical Decisions</strong>: These are made at the departmental level and involve a shorter term, typically one to three years. They are focused on achieving specific departmental goals.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Operational Decisions</strong>: Concerned with day-to-day operational issues, these decisions are made by operational level supervisors. They relate to daily duty management, machine arrangement, and other similar operational tasks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. On the Basis of Participants Involved in the Decision-Making Process:</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Individual Decisions</strong>: Decisions made by a single person, typically involving simple, routine problems within the organization.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Group Decisions</strong>: Decisions made collectively by a group of people. This approach involves discussion and sharing of opinions, ideas, and views to reach a consensus.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">What is centralization? Explain its disadvantages.</span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p style="font-weight: 400;">Centralization is the process of systematically retaining decision making power at the top level of</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">management. In simple words, holding the decision making power at the center ie. top level of the organizational structure is called centralization. It is a philosophy in which top level managers exercise all the rights of making decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage of Centralized Decision-Making</strong></p>
<p>Centralized decision-making can lead to several organizational challenges, impacting efficiency, morale, and overall effectiveness:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Delay in Decision Making</strong>: There is a potential for delays in decision-making as files and requests must move from the bottom to the top level for approval. This can slow down the process, increasing the risk of missing business opportunities and reducing profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Capacity</strong>: When all decision-making responsibility rests on one person, it limits the organization&#8217;s ability to leverage the talents and insights of other team members. A single manager may struggle to address all areas of the business effectively, resulting in slower decision processes and potentially lower-quality strategies. This limitation can adversely affect the organization&#8217;s overall performance.</li>
<li><strong>Overwork</strong>: Centralizing decision-making in one individual can lead to overwork for that person, resulting in delays and a deterioration in the quality of decisions made. This overburdening can hinder the organization&#8217;s ability to grow or diversify optimally.</li>
<li><strong>Low Morale and Motivation</strong>: When employees, especially middle managers and supervisors, do not have decision-making powers, it can lead to decreased motivation and morale. The lack of empowerment causes them to wait passively for directions from above, which can lead to frustration and job dissatisfaction. Highly skilled employees may feel underutilized and consider changing jobs.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Power Abuse</strong>: Centralized decision-making increases the risk of power abuse, where the individual in command may exploit their position for personal gain rather than the organization&#8217;s benefit. This can lead to unethical practices and harm the organization&#8217;s integrity and reputation.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Environmental Adaptation</strong>: Centralized decision-making can make an organization slow to respond to environmental changes. The decision-maker&#8217;s limited capacity to handle all strategic decisions under pressure can lead to rigidity, preventing the organization from adopting new ideas and practices, and ultimately missing out on important opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Explain the different types of leadership styles.</span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Leadership style is the manner and approach of directing, implementing plans, and motivating the people involved in an organization. The different types of leadership styles are as follows:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Authoritative Style</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Autocratic Leadership Style</strong>: Autocratic leadership centralizes all authority at the top. Leaders make decisions without consulting their team and expect complete obedience without question. They control information, rely on one-way communication, and often overlook employee motivation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Characteristics</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Leaders expect full obedience from followers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Leaders control the information and communication channel.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Leaders expect the desired output at the desired time at any cost from their followers.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Benefits</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All employees work in strict discipline, so urgent works can be accomplished at the desired time.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Employees need not be involved in the decision-making process, so decisions are made promptly.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Employees are not supposed to reject or suspect the order, so there will be strong employee motivation.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is no possibility of good human relation between managers and employees.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There is a high chance of maximum wastage of resources because of low employee job satisfaction.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Employee commitment will be low for team effort because of poor coordination.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. Democratic Leadership Style</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Under the democratic leadership style, leaders make decisions with the consent of followers. Leaders who believe in democratic leadership style delegate the authority to their subordinates. The leaders like to seek followers’ suggestions and advice in decision-making.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Disadvantages</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It is not possible to include the feelings; in this situation, employees may be frustrated.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Less experienced, unskilled, and less committed employees cannot make effective decisions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Employees are included in the decision-making process. Therefore, the decision-making becomes slow.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Benefits</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Participative approach in decision-making helps develop positive and permanent motivation.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Decisions made under this leadership style are supposed to be perfect because of the employees&#8217; participation in the decision-making process.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Employees easily accept the change in the organization. Thus, change management becomes easy in a democratic leadership style.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Characteristics</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This style follows two-way communication.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Employees are considered as important members of the organization.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Team effort is encouraged for organizational goals achievements.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. Laissez-Faire Leadership Style</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The leader in this leadership style relinquishes authority to decide onto his team. The subordinates make decisions on their own without interference from the top leader. This approach encourages self-direction, self-control, and self-motivation, and there is open two-way communication between the leader and the team.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">

<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4. Situational (Contingency) Style of Leadership</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The environment greatly influences organizations, and thus their leaders have to transform their leadership style to put up with changing times. Situational leadership is based on the idea that there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all approach to leadership. Instead, a leader&#8217;s style should shift depending on the time, place, and situation they&#8217;re facing. This approach emphasizes flexibility and adapting to changing circumstances.</span></p>

<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Define communication. Explain the barriers of effective communication.</span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The term &#8216;communication&#8217; is derived from the Latin word &#8216;communis&#8217; which means &#8216;common&#8217;. Essentially, communication involves informing, telling, or spreading information and messages to all concerned parties so that it becomes common knowledge. It is the process of transmitting messages from one party to another or from one level to another within an organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Barriers to Effective Communication</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Effective communication can be hindered by several types of barriers:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Process Barriers</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">These occur if information is distorted or disrupted at different stages of the communication process:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Encoding Issues</strong>: Excessive use of symbols in encoding can create problems for the sender.</span></li>

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Explain the basic steps in the control process. </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The control process in management involves several key steps to ensure that an organization&#8217;s objectives are met efficiently and effectively. These steps include:</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. Establishing Standards</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Description</strong>: Standards are set to establish clear goals regarding the desired outputs for projects, departments, or the entire organization. These standards serve as benchmarks for comparing actual performances.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Criteria</strong>: Effective standards are Specific, Measurable, Acceptable, Realistic, and Time-bound (SMART). Adhering to these criteria helps organizations establish reliable benchmarks that guide activities towards achieving predefined objectives.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2. Measuring Performance</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Process</strong>: Performance of individuals, units, departments, and the organization as a whole is continually assessed by supervisors, managers, or other authorized personnel.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: This measurement provides real data that is used to compare with the planned or standard performance to evaluate how well the organization is meeting its objectives.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3. Comparing Performance with Standards</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Evaluation</strong>: The actual performance is compared with the set standards to identify any deviations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Outcomes</strong>:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If actual performance matches the standards, operations are considered on track.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If actual performance exceeds the standards, it may be appropriate to redefine the benchmarks at a higher level.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If actual performance is below the standards, this deviation is considered serious and requires further analysis to determine the causes and potential corrective actions.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4. Taking Corrective Actions</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Focus</strong>: This step involves addressing any identified problems or weaknesses based on the deviations found during the performance comparison.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Actions</strong>: Managerial efforts are directed towards correcting existing issues to realign performance with organizational standards.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 13</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">What is total quality management? Explain the tools of TQM. </span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Total quality management is a management philosophy which believes in a company-wide responsibility towards gradual and continuous improvement of the quality of products. The main aim of TQM is the active involvement of the production personnel in the pursuit of quality.</p>
<p><strong>The tools of TQM are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Benchmarking</strong>: Benchmarking involves continuous comparisons of an organization&#8217;s performance with that of leading organizations to adopt best practices and improve quality. It includes services, product design, business processes, or administrative practices. Benchmarking can be internal (within the same organization) or external (with competitors or industry leaders). The steps involved in benchmarking are:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Planning</strong>: Identify important activities, define metrics, and assess organizational strengths and weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>Collection of Information</strong>: Gather data using methods like exploratory research, market research, and interviews.</li>
<li><strong>Analysis of Data</strong>: Analyze the collected data to identify performance gaps and their root causes.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: Make significant changes to close performance gaps, considering organizational culture to minimize resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Regularly evaluate the impact of changes and make necessary adjustments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ISO 9000</strong>: ISO 9000 is a set of international standards for quality management and quality assurance developed to help companies effectively document the quality system elements to be implemented to maintain an efficient quality system. They are not specific to any one industry and can be applied to organizations of any size. ISO 14000 is related to environmental management that helps organizations to minimize their environmental impact.</li>
<li><strong>Outsourcing</strong>: Outsourcing involves contracting out operations, services, or activities to external firms that can provide higher quality at lower costs, leading to greater efficiency and productivity. It allows management to focus on core activities and strategic issues.</li>
<li><strong>Right First Time</strong>: This philosophy aims for zero defects in the production process and products. It emphasizes the importance of doing things correctly the first time and avoiding a trial-and-error approach.</li>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Speed refers to the time it takes for an organization to accomplish tasks and is crucial across all aspects of developing, producing, promoting, and distributing goods and services. Being faster than competitors can provide a competitive advantage.</li>

<h3>Question 14</h3>
<div><p><div><span lang="EN-US">Define globalization. Explain the methods of globalization.</span></div</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Globalization refers to the integration of economies and societies worldwide through the exchange of technology, economics, politics, and culture. This process is facilitated by advancements in communication, transportation, and infrastructure, leading to increased international interaction of markets for goods, services, capital, and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of Globalization</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Importation and Export</strong>: This traditional method involves countries importing essentials they lack and exporting surplus products to foreign markets. It allows for international trade without establishing manufacturing facilities abroad. Trade can occur directly or through intermediaries, with preferences often influenced by relative production costs between home and foreign markets.</li>
<li><strong>Licensing and Franchising</strong>: Licensing permits foreign companies to use a firm&#8217;s technical knowledge, designs, or intellectual property in exchange for royalties. Franchising extends this concept by allowing independent businesses to operate using the franchiser&#8217;s brand and business model. These methods are particularly useful for entering developing or regulated markets.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Alliances</strong>: Also known as collaborative agreements or global strategic partnerships, strategic alliances allow firms to expand internationally by sharing technology, ideas, and business strategies without focusing on equity or ownership. Common in industries like airlines, hotels, and education, these alliances are often supported by international organizations such as the IMF, World Bank, and WTO.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</strong>: FDI involves a company making investments directly in foreign markets without reliance on joint ventures with local firms. This method enables multinational corporations (MNCs) to establish subsidiaries, maintaining full ownership, control, and profit. FDI has been widely utilized over the past 30 years, especially by Western countries investing in China and other parts of Asia.</li>
<li><strong>Joint Venture</strong>: Joint ventures involve sharing ownership issues, popular in regions where FDI restrictions exist. This method facilitates the transfer of technology, technical knowledge, ideas, and capital between developed and developing nations through joint capital investment.</li>
<li><strong>Merger and Acquisition</strong>: These are common strategies for achieving globalization, involving the combination of two firms from different countries (merger) or the acquisition of one firm by another to create a more global entity. Mergers and acquisitions were particularly prevalent strategies until the 1980s.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Policy-related Problems</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>In Nepal, fiscal and industrial policies are often ambiguous and not business-friendly. These policies frequently change, especially tax provisions, creating uncertainty and making the business environment challenging. Starting a business in Nepal is also known for being a lengthy and time-consuming process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capital and Technology-related Problems</strong>:

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor-related Problems</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Since the restoration of democracy, Nepal has seen a rise in labor problems. Strong labor unions, influenced by political parties, often prioritize party needs over organizational requirements, complicating employee management and negatively impacting business processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Raw Material-related Problems</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Production-based businesses in Nepal rely heavily on raw materials, which are often sourced from foreign suppliers with low quality and high prices or from domestic sources using outdated technology. Additionally, the availability of raw materials can be inconsistent, affecting business growth and improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Politics-related Problems</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Political stability is crucial for setting clear, stable, and business-friendly economic, fiscal, and industrial policies. However, political instability in Nepal makes it difficult for businesses to formulate long-term strategies and plans, which are essential for ensuring success.</li>

Businesses need to consider exporting value-added goods to foreign markets to overcome these challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mutual Trust-related Problems</strong>:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Establishing smooth business operations in Nepal requires good relationships and mutual trust among management, the government, and employees. However, there is a general lack of trust, with the government suspecting companies of tax evasion and labor unions often opposing management policies, which is detrimental to business success.</li>
</ul>
