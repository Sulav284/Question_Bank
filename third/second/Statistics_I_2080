<p>Compute mean, standard deviation, variance and coefficient of variation and interpret them.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Measures of Central Tendency:</p>
<p>Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that aim to describe the center or typical value of a dataset. They provide a single value that represents the &#8220;average&#8221; or central value around which the data points tend to cluster. The three main measures of central tendency are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Mean: The mean, also known as the average, is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and then dividing by the number of data points. It is represented by the symbol &#8220;μ&#8221; for the population mean and &#8220;x̄&#8221; for the sample mean. The formula for the mean is: Mean (μ or x̄) = (Σx) / n Where Σx represents the sum of all data values, and n is the number of data points.</li>
<li>Median: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is not affected by extreme values (outliers) and is often used for skewed datasets.</li>
<li>Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (multimodal), or no mode at all. The mode is useful for identifying the most common value(s) in a dataset, especially for categorical data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Measures of Dispersion:</p>
<p>Measures of dispersion, also known as measures of variability or spread, provide information about the extent to which data points deviate from the central tendency. They help us understand how scattered or spread out the data is. Some common measures of dispersion include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a rough estimate of the spread of data but is sensitive to outliers.</li>
<li>Variance: Variance measures the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. It quantifies how data points are distributed around the mean. Population variance (σ²) and sample variance (s²) are used for populations and samples, respectively.
<p>Population Variance (σ²) = Σ[(x &#8211; μ)²] / N Sample Variance (s²) = Σ[(x &#8211; x̄)²] / (n &#8211; 1)</li>
<li>Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of dispersion in the same units as the data. A smaller standard deviation indicates that data points are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates greater variability.
<p>Population Standard Deviation (σ) = √σ² Sample Standard Deviation (s) = √s²</li>
<li>Interquartile Range (IQR): The IQR is a measure of dispersion that represents the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of a dataset after sorting it. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to the range.</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): MAD is the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean. It provides a measure of the average deviation of data from the mean.</li>

<p>b. Find the regression equation of speed gain on number of weeks.</p>
<p>c. Estimate speed gain of a student who has been in program for 6 weeks and interpret the slope of the line.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Correlation is a statistical concept used to describe the relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient quantifies the strength and direction of this relationship. There are three main types of correlation: positive, negative, and perfect. Let&#8217;s discuss each of these:</p>
<p><strong>i. Positive Correlation:</strong><br />
Positive correlation occurs when an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in another variable, and a decrease in one variable is associated with a decrease in the other. In other words, as one variable goes up, the other tends to go up as well, and vice versa. The correlation coefficient for a positive correlation is typically a value between 0 and +1, where +1 represents a perfect positive correlation.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
Imagine you are studying the relationship between the number of hours students spend studying and their test scores. If you find that as the number of hours spent studying increases, the test scores also increase, it&#8217;s a positive correlation. A correlation coefficient of +0.7, for instance, would indicate a strong positive correlation.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Negative Correlation:</strong><br />
Negative correlation, on the other hand, occurs when an increase in one variable is associated with a decrease in another variable, and vice versa. In this case, as one variable goes up, the other tends to go down. The correlation coefficient for a negative correlation is typically a value between -1 and 0, where -1 represents a perfect negative correlation.</p>
<p>Example:<br />
Consider a scenario where you investigate the relationship between the amount of exercise individuals engage in per week and their body weight. If you find that as the amount of exercise increases, body weight tends to decrease, it&#8217;s a negative correlation. A correlation coefficient of -0.6, for instance, would indicate a moderately strong negative correlation.</p>
<p><strong>iii. Perfect Correlation:</strong><br />
Perfect correlation is an idealized scenario where two variables are perfectly related to each other, either positively or negatively. In a perfect positive correlation, every increase in one variable is met with a corresponding increase in the other, and the correlation coefficient is +1. In a perfect negative correlation, every increase in one variable is met with a corresponding decrease in the other, and the correlation coefficient is -1.</p>
<p>Perfect correlations are relatively rare in real-world data because they imply an exact linear relationship between the two variables. In most cases, there is some degree of variability or noise in the data, leading to correlation coefficients that are less than +1 or greater than -1.</p>

<h2>Section B: Attempt any eight questions.</h2><h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>Differentiate between primary data and secondary data. What are the sources of secondary data?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Primary data and secondary data are two types of data used in research and analysis, and they differ in terms of their sources, collection methods, and uses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Primary Data:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Primary data is data that is collected directly from original sources for a specific research purpose. It is data that researchers gather firsthand for a particular study or investigation.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Method:</strong> Primary data is collected through methods such as surveys, interviews, observations, experiments, and direct measurements. Researchers design and conduct these data collection activities themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Freshness:</strong> Primary data is typically current and specific to the research question at hand.</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Researchers have control over the collection process and can tailor it to their specific research needs.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Responses from a survey conducted for a research project, measurements taken during a laboratory experiment, or observations made during ethnographic fieldwork.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Data:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Secondary data refers to data that has already been collected and compiled by someone else for a purpose other than the current research. It involves using existing data sources to analyze, interpret, or draw conclusions for a different research objective.</li>
<li><strong>Collection Method:</strong> Secondary data is collected by organizations, government agencies, research institutions, or individuals for purposes other than the researcher&#8217;s current project.</li>
<li><strong>Freshness:</strong> Secondary data may be historical or less current compared to primary data, as it was collected for a different reason and at a different time.</li>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> Researchers have limited control over the data collection process because they did not collect the data themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Census data, financial reports, academic journals, market research reports, historical documents, and publicly available datasets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Sources of Secondary Data:</strong> Secondary data can be obtained from various sources, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Government Sources:</strong> Government agencies often collect and publish data on various topics, such as demographics, economics, health, and education. Examples include the U.S. Census Bureau, the World Health Organization (WHO), and national statistical offices.</li>
<li><strong>Academic Publications:</strong> Peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and academic publications contain research findings, data, and statistics that can be used as secondary sources.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Sources:</strong> Market research firms, business intelligence companies, and industry reports provide data on markets, consumer behavior, and industry trends.</li>
<li><strong>Nonprofit Organizations:</strong> Nonprofits, think tanks, and research organizations conduct studies and compile data on various social, economic, and environmental issues.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Reports:</strong> Publicly traded companies release annual reports, financial statements, and other corporate documents that contain data on their financial performance, operations, and market insights.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries and Archives:</strong> Libraries, archives, and historical repositories house a wealth of primary and secondary sources, including books, manuscripts, newspapers, and government records.</li>
<li><strong>Online Databases:</strong> There are numerous online databases and data repositories that offer access to a wide range of secondary data, such as government data portals, academic databases, and data-sharing platforms.</li>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>What is sampling?

<p><strong>Sampling</strong> is a fundamental technique in statistics and research methodology that involves selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population to study and draw conclusions about the entire population. Sampling is commonly used because it is often impractical or too expensive to collect data from an entire population. Instead, researchers use a sample that is representative of the population to make inferences.</p>
<p><strong>1. Simple Random Sampling:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Simple random sampling is a method in which each individual or item in the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample. It involves randomly selecting individuals without any specific criteria or categories.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you want to conduct a survey to determine the average income of households in a city with a population of 10,000. To perform simple random sampling, you could assign a unique number to each household, and then use a random number generator to select 500 households from the list. This ensures that every household has an equal probability of being chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Stratified Random Sampling:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Stratified random sampling is a method in which the population is divided into distinct subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income level), and then a random sample is taken from each subgroup. This ensures that each stratum is represented in the final sample, making it useful for studying specific subgroups.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine you want to assess the educational performance of students in a large school with 2,000 students. You decide to use stratified random sampling by first categorizing the students into three strata: freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. Then, you randomly select 50 students from each stratum to create your sample. This approach ensures that you have a representative sample from each grade level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Comparison:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Simple Random Sampling</strong> is suitable when the population is relatively homogenous, and there are no specific subgroups or characteristics of interest. It is a straightforward method but may not efficiently capture specific subpopulations.</li>
<li><strong>Stratified Random Sampling</strong>, on the other hand, is useful when there are distinct subgroups within the population that you want to study separately or when you want to ensure proportional representation of certain characteristics. It can provide more precise estimates for each stratum but requires knowledge of the population&#8217;s characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both sampling methods aim to reduce bias and ensure the sample accurately represents the population, but the choice between them depends on the research objectives and the characteristics of the population being studied.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>What aspect of summary measures of data can be explained by the measures of skewness? Kelvin Hota is the national sales manager for National Text Books. He has a sales staff of 10 who visit college professors all over the United States. Each Sunday morning he requires his sales staffs to send him a report. Listed below are the number of visits last week.</p>
<p>25, 6, 10, 13, 15, 2, 18, 5, 20, 30</p>
<p>Compute the five number summary.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry or departure from symmetry in a dataset. It helps us understand the shape of the data distribution. Skewness can be either positive (right-skewed) or negative (left-skewed), or it can be close to zero (approximately symmetric).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>If skewness is <strong>positive (right-skewed)</strong>, it means that the right tail (larger values) of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left tail. This indicates that there are some high outliers in the data, and the majority of the data points are concentrated on the left side.</li>
<li>If skewness is <strong>negative (left-skewed)</strong>, it means that the left tail (smaller values) of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right tail. This suggests that there are some low outliers in the data, and most data points are concentrated on the right side.</li>
<li>If skewness is <strong>close to zero</strong>, it implies that the data distribution is approximately symmetric.</li>

<p>i. The minimum marks obtained by top 10% students.</p>
<p>ii. modal marks.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>In statistics, an &#8220;average&#8221; is a measure of central tendency that summarizes a dataset by providing a single representative value. To ensure that an average is meaningful and useful in statistical analysis, certain requisites or criteria should be considered:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Representativeness:</strong> A good average should accurately represent the central or typical value of the dataset. It should provide a value that is not unduly influenced by extreme outliers or skewed data points.</li>
<li><strong>Additivity:</strong> The average should be additive, meaning that if you calculate the average of subgroups or segments of the data and then combine them, the overall average should be consistent with the original dataset&#8217;s average. This property is important for aggregating data.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Interpretation:</strong> The average should be easily understood and interpreted by the audience or users of the data. It should convey a clear sense of the dataset&#8217;s central tendency without requiring complex explanations.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriateness to Data Type:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Arithmetic Mean:</strong> This is the most commonly used average and is suitable for interval and ratio data. It is the sum of all values divided by the number of values (n). It has the properties of additivity and is scale-dependent.</li>
<li><strong>Median:</strong> The median is suitable for ordinal, interval, and ratio data. It represents the middle value when the data is sorted. It is robust against outliers and skewed distributions.</li>
<li><strong>Mode:</strong> The mode is suitable for nominal and ordinal data. It represents the most frequent value(s) in a dataset.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Robustness:</strong> A good average should be robust against outliers or extreme values that can distort the interpretation of central tendency. The median and mode are often preferred when dealing with skewed or non-normally distributed data.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Research Objectives:</strong> The choice of average should align with the research question or objectives. Depending on the goals of the analysis, one type of average may be more appropriate than another.</li>
<li><strong>Scale Independence:</strong> The average should not be influenced by the choice of measurement units. It should give the same result regardless of whether the data is expressed in different units (e.g., pounds or kilograms).</li>
<li><strong>Statistical Properties:</strong> Some averages have specific statistical properties. For example, the arithmetic mean minimizes the sum of squared deviations from the mean (least squares), which is important in various statistical techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Context Sensitivity:</strong> Consider the context of the data and the research problem. Sometimes, multiple averages may need to be calculated and compared to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dataset.</li>
<li><strong>Availability and Quality of Data:</strong> The choice of average should take into account the availability and quality of data. In some cases, you may need to use the average that can be calculated based on the data you have.</li>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>Define independent and mutually exclusive events. Three groups of children 2 boys and 2 girls, 3 boys and 1 girl,  1 boy and 3 girls respectively. One child is selected at random from each group. Find the probability of selecting one boy and two girls.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Independent Events:</strong> Independent events are events in probability theory that are not influenced by each other. In other words, the occurrence or outcome of one event does not affect the occurrence or outcome of another event. Mathematically, two events A and B are independent if and only if the probability of both events occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:</p>
<p>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)</p>
<p>In simple terms, the probability of event A happening doesn&#8217;t change based on whether event B occurs or not, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong>Mutually Exclusive Events:</strong> Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. If one of these events happens, it prevents the other(s) from occurring simultaneously. In a probability context, the probability of the intersection of mutually exclusive events is zero:</p>
<p>P(A and B) = 0</p>
<p>This means that the events have no outcomes in common.</p>

<p><strong>Binomial Distribution:</strong> The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes (often denoted as &#8220;x&#8221;) in a fixed number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials. Each Bernoulli trial is characterized by two possible outcomes: success (often denoted as &#8220;p&#8221;) and failure (often denoted as &#8220;q,&#8221; where q = 1 &#8211; p). The binomial distribution is defined by two parameters:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>n</strong>: The number of trials or attempts.</li>
<li><strong>p</strong>: The probability of success on each trial.</li>

<p><strong>Conditions for Appropriate Use of the Binomial Distribution:</strong> The binomial distribution is appropriate under the following conditions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Binary Outcomes:</strong> Each trial must have only two possible outcomes, often referred to as success and failure.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Number of Trials (n):</strong> The number of trials (n) must be fixed in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Independence:</strong> Each trial must be independent of the others. The outcome of one trial should not affect the outcome of another.</li>
<li><strong>Constant Probability of Success (p):</strong> The probability of success (p) must remain constant from trial to trial.</li>
<li><strong>Discrete Data:</strong> The random variable representing the number of successes (X) is discrete, meaning it can take on only whole-number values.</li>

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>State features of normal distribution. In a photographic process, the developing time of prints as a random variable having normal distribution with mean of 18.25 seconds with standard deviation 0.34 seconds. Find the probability that at least 17.64 seconds to develop one of the prints.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Features of Normal Distribution:</strong></p>
<p>The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a continuous probability distribution that is characterized by several key features:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean (μ). The mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Bell-Shaped Curve:</strong> The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution forms a bell-shaped curve, with the highest point at the mean and tails that extend infinitely in both directions.</li>
<li><strong>Unimodal:</strong> The normal distribution is unimodal, meaning it has a single peak.</li>
<li><strong>Parameters:</strong> The distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean determines the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation controls the spread or dispersion of the data. The larger the standard deviation, the wider the distribution.</li>
<li><strong>68-95-99.7 Rule:</strong> In a normal distribution:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.</li>
<li>Approximately 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.</li>
<li>Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Continuous:</strong> The normal distribution is defined for all real numbers, and it is a continuous distribution.</li>

<h3>Question 13</h3>
<div><p><p>Define random variable. If X is the number of points rolled with a balanced die, find E(X) and variance of X. Also find the expected value of random variable g(Y)=2X²+1.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Random Variable:</strong> A random variable is a mathematical function or mapping that assigns numerical values to the outcomes of a random experiment or process. It represents a quantity whose value depends on chance or randomness. In other words, it&#8217;s a variable that can take on different values based on the outcomes of a random event.</p>
