    <h2>Group A: Attempt any three questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>Define system of linear equations. When a system of equations is consistent? Make echelon form to solve:</p>
<p>-2a – 3b + 4c = 5</p>
<p>b – 2c = 4</p>
<p>a + 3b – c = 2</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A system of linear equations is a collection of one or more linear equations involving one or more variables. Each equation in the system is a linear combination of the variables, and the goal is to find values for the variables that satisfy all the equations simultaneously. In general, a system of linear equations can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + a₃x₃ + &#8230; + aₙxₙ = b₁<br />
a₁&#8217;x₁ + a₂&#8217;x₂ + a₃&#8217;x₃ + &#8230; + aₙ&#8217;xₙ = b₂<br />
a₁&#8221;x₁ + a₂&#8221;x₂ + a₃&#8221;x₃ + &#8230; + aₙ&#8221;xₙ = b₃<br />
&#8230;<br />
a₁ᵤx₁ + a₂ᵤx₂ + a₃ᵤx₃ + &#8230; + aₙᵤxₙ = bᵤ</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>x₁, x₂, x₃, &#8230;, xₙ are the variables.</li>
<li>a₁, a₂, a₃, &#8230;, aₙ are the coefficients of the variables in the first equation.</li>
<li>b₁ is the constant on the right side of the first equation.</li>
<li>Similarly, a₁&#8217;, a₂&#8217;, a₃&#8217;, &#8230;, aₙ&#8217;, b₂, a₁&#8221;, a₂&#8221;, a₃&#8221;, &#8230;, aₙ&#8221;, b₃, and so on represent the coefficients and constants in the subsequent equations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A system of linear equations is consistent when it has at least one solution, which means there is a set of values for the variables that satisfies all the equations in the system. In other words, a system of equations is consistent if there is at least one combination of values for the variables that makes all the equations true simultaneously.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>

<p>and define a transformation T : R² → R² by T(x) = Ax then</p>

<p>b. Find x ∈ R² whose image under T is b.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A linear transformation, in the context of linear algebra, is a function that maps vectors from one vector space to another in a way that preserves certain algebraic properties. Specifically, a linear transformation satisfies two fundamental properties:</p>
<p><strong>1. Additivity</strong>: If you apply the transformation to the sum of two vectors, it&#8217;s the same as applying the transformation to each vector separately and then adding the results. Mathematically, for vectors <code>v</code> and <code>w</code> and a linear transformation <code>T</code>, this property can be written as:</p>
<p>T(v + w) = T(v) + T(w)</p>
<p><strong>2. Scalar Multiplication</strong>: If you scale a vector and then apply the transformation, it&#8217;s the same as first applying the transformation and then scaling the result. Mathematically, for a scalar <code>c</code> and a vector <code>v</code>, this property can be written as:</p>
<p>T(c * v) = c * T(v)</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Find AB by block multiplication of the matrices.</p>
<p>A=<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25444" src="https://hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/a-1.jpg" alt="" width="153" height="71"> B=<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-25445" src="https://hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b-1.jpg" alt="" width="67" height="98"></p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Given matrices:</p>
<p>$$<br />
A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; -3 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; -4 &amp; -2 \\ 1 &amp; -5 &amp; -2 \\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 7 \\ -4 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} 6 &amp; 4 \\ 2 &amp; -1 \\ -3 &amp; 7 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \\ 5 &amp; -3 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>We partition the matrices as:</p>
<p>$$<br />
A = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{bmatrix}, \quad B = \begin{bmatrix} B_1 \\ B_2 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{11} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; -3 \\ 1 &amp; -5 \\ 1 &amp; -2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad A_{12} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -4 \\ 3 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad A_{21} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -4 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad A_{22} = \begin{bmatrix} 7 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$<br />
$$<br />
B_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 6 &amp; 4 \\ 2 &amp; -1 \\ -3 &amp; 7 \end{bmatrix}, \quad B_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 5 \\ 3 &amp; -3 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>The formula for matrix multiplication is:</p>
<p>$$<br />
AB = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} B_1 + A_{12} B_2 \\ A_{21} B_1 + A_{22} B_2 \end{bmatrix}$$</p>
<p>Step 1: Compute each block</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{11} B_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 2(6) + (-3)(2) + 1(-3) \\ 2(4) + (-3)(-1) + 1(7) \\ 1(6) + (-5)(2) + (-2)(-3) \\ 1(4) + (-5)(-1) + (-2)(7) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 18 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{12} B_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0(1) + (-4)(5) \\ 0(3) + (-4)(-3) \\ 3(1) + (-1)(5) \\ 3(3) + (-1)(-3) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -20 \\ 12 \\ -2 \\ 12 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{21} B_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 0(6) + (-4)(2) + (-2)(-3) \\ 0(4) + (-4)(-1) + (-2)(7) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ -10 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{22} B_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 7(1) + (-1)(5) \\ 7(3) + (-1)(-3) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 24 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>Step 2: Add the results</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{11} B_1 + A_{12} B_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 18 \\ 2 \\ -5 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} -20 \\ 12 \\ -2 \\ 12 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -17 \\ 30 \\ 0 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>$$<br />
A_{21} B_1 + A_{22} B_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ -10 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 24 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 14 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>
<p>Thus, the final result of matrix multiplication is:</p>
<p>$$<br />
AB = \begin{bmatrix} -17 &amp; 30 \\ 0 &amp; 7 \\ 0 &amp; 14 \end{bmatrix}<br />
$$</p>

<p>In other words, if you have two column vectors in R²:</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p>Vector A = [3, 4] Vector B = [3, 4]</p>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>Prove that the two vectors u and v are perpendicular to each other if and only if the line through u is perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>To prove that two vectors u and v are perpendicular to each other if and only if the line through u is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v, we will break the proof into two parts: the &#8220;if&#8221; part and the &#8220;only if&#8221; part.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;If&#8221; Part:</strong> First, let&#8217;s prove that if u and v are perpendicular to each other, then the line through u is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v.</p>
<p>Assume that u and v are perpendicular vectors, which means their dot product is zero:</p>
<p>u · v = 0</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s consider the line through u. This line can be represented as the set of all points parameterized by t as follows:</p>
<p>L(u) = {-u + tu | t ∈ ℝ}</p>
<p>Here, -u is a point on the line (t = 0), and tu represents all points on the line as t varies.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s find the midpoint of the line segment from -u to v, which is the average of -u and v:</p>
<p>Midpoint = (-u + v) / 2</p>
<p>Now, we need to show that the line through u is perpendicular to this line segment. To do this, we will show that the direction vector of the line through u is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vector from -u to v, which is v &#8211; (-u) = v + u.</p>
<p>The direction vector of the line through u is u (since u parameterizes the line), and we want to show that u · (v + u) = 0. Let&#8217;s calculate the dot product:</p>
<p>u · (v + u) = u · v + u · u</p>
<p>We know that u · v = 0 (because u and v are perpendicular). Now, we need to determine whether u · u = 0. If u · u = 0, it means u is a zero vector, which would contradict the assumption that u and v are perpendicular. Therefore, u · u ≠ 0.</p>
<p>Since u · u ≠ 0, we have:</p>
<p>u · (v + u) ≠ 0</p>
<p>This means that the line through u is not perpendicular to the line segment from -u to v when u and v are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, the &#8220;if&#8221; part is proved.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Only If&#8221; Part:</strong> Now, let&#8217;s prove the &#8220;only if&#8221; part, which means if the line through u is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v, then u and v are perpendicular.</p>
<p>Assume that the line through u is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v. This means that the midpoint of the line segment is on the line through u, and the line through u is perpendicular to the line segment.</p>
<p>The midpoint of the line segment from -u to v is given as:</p>
<p>Midpoint = (-u + v) / 2</p>
<p>We are given that the line through u is perpendicular to this line segment. Therefore, the direction vector of the line through u, which is u, must be orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vector from -u to v, which is v &#8211; (-u) = v + u.</p>
<p>So, u · (v + u) = 0</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s expand the dot product:</p>
<p>u · (v + u) = u · v + u · u</p>
<p>Since u · (v + u) = 0, we have:</p>
<p>u · v + u · u = 0</p>
<p>Now, subtract u · u from both sides:</p>
<p>u · v = -u · u</p>
<p>If u · u ≠ 0, then we can divide both sides of the equation by u · u (which is a scalar), and we would have:</p>
<p>(u · v) / (u · u) = -1</p>
<p>However, this would mean that v is a scalar multiple of u (v = -u), which contradicts our assumption that the line through u is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v. Therefore, the only way for this equation to hold is if u · u = 0.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;ve shown that u · u = 0, it means u is a zero vector:</p>
<p>u · u = 0 ⟹ u = 0</p>
<p>If u is the zero vector, then v · u = 0 for any vector v, which means that u and v are perpendicular.</p>
<p>Therefore, the &#8220;only if&#8221; part is proved.</p>
<p>Combining both parts, we have shown that two vectors u and v are perpendicular to each other if and only if the line through u is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from -u to v.</p>

<h3>Question 14</h3>
<div><p><p>Define group. Show that the set of integers is a group with respect to addition operation.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A group is a fundamental algebraic structure in abstract algebra that consists of a set together with an operation that combines elements from the set and satisfies four key properties:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Closure</strong>: For any two elements, a and b, in the group, their combination under the group operation must also be in the group. In other words, a * b is an element of the group.</li>
<li><strong>Associativity</strong>: The group operation is associative, which means that for any three elements a, b, and c in the group, the following equality holds: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c).</li>
<li><strong>Identity Element</strong>: There exists an identity element, denoted as &#8220;e&#8221; or &#8220;1,&#8221; such that for any element &#8220;a&#8221; in the group, the following equation is true: a * e = e * a = a.</li>
<li><strong>Inverse Element</strong>: For each element &#8220;a&#8221; in the group, there exists an inverse element &#8220;b&#8221; such that a * b = b * a = e, where &#8220;e&#8221; is the identity element.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s demonstrate that the set of integers, denoted as Z, forms a group with respect to the addition operation (+):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Closure</strong>: For any two integers &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b,&#8221; their sum &#8220;a + b&#8221; is also an integer. Therefore, closure is satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>Associativity</strong>: Addition of integers is associative, meaning that for any integers &#8220;a,&#8221; &#8220;b,&#8221; and &#8220;c,&#8221; we have (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). This property holds.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Element</strong>: The identity element for addition in the set of integers is &#8220;0.&#8221; For any integer &#8220;a,&#8221; we have a + 0 = 0 + a = a. Therefore, the identity element is present.</li>
<li><strong>Inverse Element</strong>: For every integer &#8220;a,&#8221; its inverse with respect to addition is the negative of itself, denoted as &#8220;-a.&#8221; This means that a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0. Thus, every integer has an inverse element.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the set of integers satisfies all four properties of a group with respect to addition, it is indeed a group under addition. This group is known as the additive group of integers, often denoted as (Z, +), where &#8220;Z&#8221; represents the set of integers, and &#8220;+&#8221; represents the addition operation.</p>

To be considered a ring, the following conditions must be satisfied:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Closure under Addition</strong>: For any two elements &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; in the ring, their sum &#8220;a + b&#8221; must also be in the ring.</li>
<li><strong>Associativity of Addition</strong>: Addition in the ring must be associative, meaning that for any elements &#8220;a,&#8221; &#8220;b,&#8221; and &#8220;c&#8221; in the ring, the equation (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) holds.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of an Additive Identity</strong>: There exists an additive identity element, denoted as &#8220;0&#8221; (zero), such that for any element &#8220;a&#8221; in the ring, the equation a + 0 = 0 + a = a holds.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of Additive Inverses</strong>: For each element &#8220;a&#8221; in the ring, there exists an additive inverse element, denoted as &#8220;-a,&#8221; such that a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0.</li>
<li><strong>Closure under Multiplication</strong>: For any two elements &#8220;a&#8221; and &#8220;b&#8221; in the ring, their product &#8220;a * b&#8221; must also be in the ring.</li>
<li><strong>Associativity of Multiplication</strong>: Multiplication in the ring must be associative, meaning that for any elements &#8220;a,&#8221; &#8220;b,&#8221; and &#8220;c&#8221; in the ring, the equation (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) holds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s examine the set of positive integers, denoted as <strong>N+</strong>, and determine whether it forms a ring with respect to addition and multiplication:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Closure under Addition</strong>: The set of positive integers is closed under addition. If you add two positive integers, the result is also a positive integer.</li>
<li><strong>Associativity of Addition</strong>: Addition of positive integers is associative. This property holds.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of an Additive Identity</strong>: The set of positive integers does not contain an additive identity &#8220;0&#8221; because it starts from 1 and does not include zero. Therefore, this property is not satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>Existence of Additive Inverses</strong>: The set of positive integers does not contain additive inverses. For any positive integer &#8220;a,&#8221; there is no positive integer &#8220;-a&#8221; such that a + (-a) = 0 because negative integers are not included. Therefore, this property is not satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>Closure under Multiplication</strong>: The set of positive integers is closed under multiplication. If you multiply two positive integers, the result is also a positive integer.</li>
<li><strong>Associativity of Multiplication</strong>: Multiplication of positive integers is associative. This property holds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the set of positive integers does not satisfy the properties of having an additive identity and additive inverses, it does not form a ring with respect to addition and multiplication. Therefore, the set of positive integers is not a ring; it is an example of a semiring.</p>
