    <h2>SECTION A: Attempt any TWO question.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the benefits of using E-governance for both government and citizens? Why is it necessary to implement E-governance to provide government services to citizens efficiently? Explain with suitable example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>We need e-governance for government due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Increase efficiency and effectiveness of government works.</li>
<li>Smoother and faster delivery of govt works like distributing ID Cards, Citizenship certificates, and Issuing clearances to documents (land, Tax).</li>
<li>Pro-active participation of Government representatives, Bureaucrats.</li>
<li>Increase Transparency.</li>
<li>To make govt officials respectful, responsible, and dutiful.</li>
</ol>
<p>We need e-governance for citizens due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Direct accessibility for the citizens.</li>
<li>Active participation of citizens in government activities.</li>
<li>No Favouritism and Nepotism in terms of service delivery.</li>
<li>No Need to involve third parties by paying more money than required.</li>
<li>Proper communication between citizens.</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementing e-governance is necessary to provide government services to citizens efficiently and effectively due to several reasons. One suitable example to illustrate this is the implementation of an online portal for citizen registration and issuance of identification documents.</p>
<p>In a traditional, non-digitized system, citizens would typically have to visit multiple government offices, fill out numerous forms, and submit various documents to obtain identification documents such as a national ID card or a passport. This process is time-consuming, requires physical presence, and often involves long waiting times.</p>
<p>However, with the implementation of e-governance, citizens can access a centralized online portal where they can register for identification documents and submit the required information and documents electronically. The portal can have user-friendly interfaces and guides to assist citizens in completing the necessary steps. Through the portal, citizens can upload digital copies of their documents, provide the required personal information, and track the progress of their applications.</p>
<p>By implementing e-governance in this scenario, several benefits are achieved:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The online portal streamlines the process, reducing the need for physical visits to multiple government offices. Citizens can complete the application at their convenience, saving time and effort. The automation of document verification and application processing also speeds up the overall process.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Citizens can access the online portal from anywhere with internet connectivity, eliminating geographical constraints. They can submit applications outside of traditional office hours, avoiding the need to take time off from work or other obligations. The portal offers a convenient and accessible platform for citizens to interact with the government and access services.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Through the online portal, citizens can track the status of their application and receive notifications or updates on the progress. This enhances transparency and eliminates the uncertainty associated with traditional paper-based processes. Citizens have clear visibility into the process and can easily inquire about any delays or issues.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy and Data Integrity:</strong> E-governance systems can have built-in validation checks to ensure that citizens provide accurate and complete information during the application process. This reduces errors, enhances data integrity, and minimizes the need for manual data entry by government officials. The use of digital documents and data also reduces the risk of document loss or tampering.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing e-governance, the process of obtaining identification documents becomes efficient, convenient, transparent, and accurate. This example demonstrates how e-governance improves the delivery of government services, simplifies procedures for citizens, and enhances the overall citizen experience. It showcases the potential for digital platforms to revolutionize traditional bureaucratic processes and make government services more citizen-centric and accessible.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>Why is it necessary to use E-Government model? Explain interactive service model and critical flow model in detail.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><h3>Interactive Service Model / Government to Citizen to Government Model (G2C2G):</h3>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong></p>
<p>This is also a two-way or multiple-way communication model. The interactive service model is the action or process of making something stronger or more solid. This model establishes communication between government to citizens and citizens to government. For example, if the government builds a web application about the tax, public use that website to pay their taxes and they will get the receipt. This establishes the relation between government to citizens to government.</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-50707 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Service-Delivery-model.drawio.png?resize=365%2C257&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="365" height="257"></p>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong><br />
This model could be applied in the following possible ways:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>To establish interactive communication channels with key policymakers and members of planning commissions.</li>
<li>To conduct electronic ballots for the election of government officials and other office bearers.</li>
<li>To conduct public debates on issues of wider concern before the formulation of policies and laws framework.</li>
<li>Establishing decentralized forms of governance.</li>
<li>Carrying out video conferencing and online discussion with policymakers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Critical Flow Model:</h3>
<p><strong>Principle:</strong><br />
This model is based on channeling information of critical value to a targeted audience or spreading it into the wider public domain through the use of ICT and convergent media. It requires foresight to understand the significance of a particular information set and using it accordingly. It may also involve leaking issues to whom the availability of a particular information set would make a critical difference in monitoring good governance.<br />
The strength of the critical-flow model is the inherent characteristic of ICT that makes the idea of distance and time redundant.</p>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-50708 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Critical-model.drawio.png?resize=289%2C289&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="289" height="289"></p>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Making available corruption-related data about a particular Ministry/Division/Officials online to the concerned regulatory body.</li>
<li>Making available research studies, enquiry reports, and impact studies commissioned by the Government.</li>
<li>Making available human rights violation and criminal charge records against government officials to NGOs and concerned citizens.</li>
<li>Making available environment-related information to local communities.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>What different infrastructure are necessary to implement E-governance? Explain different computing infrastructure necessary to implement E-governance.</p>
<p> </p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>The different infrastructures necessary to build e-governance are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Data systems infrastructure: The core of e-governance is e-MIS, electronic Management Information System. The data that was managed manually, needs to be computerized or bought into electronic form which means that the preparedness of computerized database or data warehouse is required. Data quality and data security are of prime concern here as most of the government infrastructures are not up to the mark in developing countries. This is the core computerization activity of any government process which may take several years to reach this stage.</li>
<li>Legal Infrastructure preparedness: They lack necessary laws and legal infrastructures to enable reengineering of the existing business practices, rules and regulations within the government at various levels. This seems to be highlighted in developing countries while developed countries have been significantly successful in administrative reforms and business reengineering. The fundamental question that arises here is &#8220;Are the laws and regulations required to permit and support the move towards e-governance initiatives in place?&#8221;. Eg:- Digital Signature Act.</li>
<li>Institutional Infrastructure Preparedness: For any government to implement a successful e-governance project, the required institutional infrastructure must be in place which most of the government lack. The government body has to establish a separate IT department which basically coordinates with e-government projects within the nation. The IT department works out for the hardware selection and acquirement, network or software development and implementation and also the training of staff at various levels of government. Many countries still lack the institutional infrastructure.</li>
<li>Human Infrastructural Preparedness: Human resource development by training is an essential requirement which comes from well trained manpower both technical and non-technical. The technical manpower resources are essential for all the phases of e-governance and related information system life cycle comprising systems analysis, design, programming, implementation, operation and documentation. Both private and government institutions should play a major role in this regard. Apart from technical human infrastructure, there is a need for training and orientation of user personnel. Such training will make them capable of handling e-governance projects.</li>
<li>Technological Infrastructural Preparedness: Technology is fast changing in ICT domain and there is a requirement of great financial support time for software and hardware. Government organization&#8217;s encounter this situation especially as their procedures. The technological infrastructure in developing countries including computing and telecommunication is absent. As a result, software and hardware may not be compatible.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the different infrastructures necessary to build e-governance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second part</p>
<p>Infrastructure is the foundation or framework that supports a system of government or organization. Computing Infrastructure provides management and support for end-user computers, servers, storage systems, operating systems, databases, middleware and ERP (Enterprise resource planning) systems. There are three groups that make up the computing infrastructure team:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Database and ERP Administration: It manages and supports the main database infrastructure for core applications used by staff, faculty and students, based on Oracle database software. It also manages and supports Oracle and MySQL databases for variety of administrative and academic needs.</li>
<li>End-user computing: The end-user computing group consists of two teams that provide personal computer management, support and assistance to faculty and staff. The end-user computing infrastructure team provides back-end management and support for a number of key applications. End-user computing group as a unit, works very closely with other groups within CCS and other departments, to ensure that the best solutions and services are delivered in a secure and manageable way.</li>
<li>Server and Storage Services: The server and storage services group is responsible for the CCS managed data centers, servers and storage systems that provide infrastructure resources to applications and services used by the staff, faculty and students. The server and storage services group is also responsible for establishing standard server and storage platforms and for the management fo the hardware and software required to integrate these platforms to deliver and efficient, scalable and cost-effective infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence, these are the various computer infrastructure necessary to implement E-governance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This level corresponds to the stage when the organization actually realizes the complete e-governance plan. Consequently, an integrated system is established where all the internal processes of the organization are computerized and there is seamless information exchange among all concerned entities.<br />
The organization starts delivering the services to its external as well as internal customers/users in an effective manner.Complete realization of the plan, in a single instance, would entail an enormous amount of resources in terms of time, money, and manpower, which may necessitate adopting a phased approach for the operation of the e-governance services.</p>
<p>This level have sub-level as:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Retrospected</strong>:<br />
At this level, organization studies its business processes in view of its vision, overall e-governance objectives, and changes if any required.</li>
<li><strong>E-ready</strong>:<br />
In this stage, e-readiness essentials, which are also the building blocks for e-governance, are ensured by the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Partially Open</strong>:<br />
At this stage some of the e-governance services are operationalized resulting in a partial information exchange among the entities both within and outside the organization.</li>
<li><strong>Open</strong>:<br />
This implies complete deployment of e-governance services that ensure an integrated system that is open to information exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>What is cyber law? How can we use this law to protect government data?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Cyber law is the part of the overall legal system that deals with the Internet, cyberspace and their respective legal issues. Cyber law covers a fairly broad area, encompassing several subtopics including freedom of expression, access to and usage of the internet, and online privacy. The first cyber law was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), enacted in 1986. This law prohibits unauthorized access to computers and includes details about the levels of punishment for breaking the law. We can use cyber law to protect government data in the following ways:</p>
