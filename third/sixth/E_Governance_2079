    <h2>Section A: Attempt any two questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>Why is it necessary to implement E-Governance to provide government services to citizens efficiently and effectively? Explain using suitable example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Implementing e-governance is necessary to provide government services to citizens efficiently and effectively due to several reasons. One suitable example to illustrate this is the implementation of an online portal for citizen registration and issuance of identification documents.</p>
<p>In a traditional, non-digitized system, citizens would typically have to visit multiple government offices, fill out numerous forms, and submit various documents to obtain identification documents such as a national ID card or a passport. This process is time-consuming, requires physical presence, and often involves long waiting times.</p>
<p>However, with the implementation of e-governance, citizens can access a centralized online portal where they can register for identification documents and submit the required information and documents electronically. The portal can have user-friendly interfaces and guides to assist citizens in completing the necessary steps. Through the portal, citizens can upload digital copies of their documents, provide the required personal information, and track the progress of their applications.</p>
<p>By implementing e-governance in this scenario, several benefits are achieved:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: The online portal streamlines the process, reducing the need for physical visits to multiple government offices. Citizens can complete the application at their convenience, saving time and effort. The automation of document verification and application processing also speeds up the overall process.</li>
<li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Citizens can access the online portal from anywhere with internet connectivity, eliminating geographical constraints. They can submit applications outside of traditional office hours, avoiding the need to take time off from work or other obligations. The portal offers a convenient and accessible platform for citizens to interact with the government and access services.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Through the online portal, citizens can track the status of their application and receive notifications or updates on the progress. This enhances transparency and eliminates the uncertainty associated with traditional paper-based processes. Citizens have clear visibility into the process and can easily inquire about any delays or issues.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy and Data Integrity:</strong> E-governance systems can have built-in validation checks to ensure that citizens provide accurate and complete information during the application process. This reduces errors, enhances data integrity, and minimizes the need for manual data entry by government officials. The use of digital documents and data also reduces the risk of document loss or tampering.</li>
</ul>
<p>By implementing e-governance, the process of obtaining identification documents becomes efficient, convenient, transparent, and accurate. This example demonstrates how e-governance improves the delivery of government services, simplifies procedures for citizens, and enhances the overall citizen experience. It showcases the potential for digital platforms to revolutionize traditional bureaucratic processes and make government services more citizen-centric and accessible.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>Why do we need E-Governance model? Explain comparative analysis model, and mobilization and lobbying model in detail.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>E-governance models are essential to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of government operations. It promotes citizen engagement and participation by providing opportunities for feedback, consultation, and involvement in decision-making processes. Additionally, these models improve the accessibility of government services, especially for individuals in remote or underserved areas.  e-governance models transform the way governments operate, making them more efficient, transparent, and responsive to citizen needs.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative Analysis Model </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The Comparative Analysis Model is based on exploring information available in the public or private domain and comparing it with the actual known information sets to derive strategic learnings and arguments.</li>
<li>This model empowers people by comparing cases of bad governance with those of good governance and identifying specific aspects of bad governance, the reasons and people behind them, and how the situation can be improved.</li>
<li>The comparison could be made over a time scale to get a snapshot of the past and the present situation or could be used to compare the effectiveness of an intervention by comparing two similar situations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>To learn from past policies and actions and derive learning lessons for future policy-making.</li>
<li>To evaluate the effectiveness of the current policies and identify key learning in terms of strengths and flaws in the policies.</li>
<li>To effectively establish conditions of precedence, especially in the case of Judicial or legal decision-making (for resolving patent-related disputes, public goods ownership rights), and use it to influence/ advocate future decision-making.</li>
<li>To evaluate the performance and track record of a particular decision-maker/decision-making body.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merits :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Based on the existing sets of information</li>
<li>Watch-guard organizations and monitor groups can use this model to continuously track the governance past record and performance and compare with different information sets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Demerits :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Requires the ability to analyze and bring out strong arguments</li>
<li>Ineffective in the absence of a strong civil society interest and public memory which is essential to force decision-makers to improve existing governance practices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobilization and Lobbying Model </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Mobilisation and Lobbying Model is one of the most frequently used digital governance models and has often come to the aid of civil society organizations in developing countries to impact international decision-making processes.</li>
<li>It is based on setting up a planned, directed flow of information to build strong virtual allies to complement actions in the real world.</li>
<li>Virtual communities are formed which share similar values and concerns, and these communities in turn link up with or support real-life groups/ activities for concerted action.</li>
<li>It builds the momentum of real-world processes by adding the opinions and concerns expressed by virtual communities.</li>
<li>The strength of this model is in its diversity of the virtual community, and the ideas, expertise and resources accumulated through this virtual form of networking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>This model could be applied in the following possible ways:</li>
<li>Fostering public debates on issues of larger concern, namely on the themes of upcoming conferences, treaties, etc.</li>
<li>Making available opinions of suppressed groups who are not involved in the decision-making process into the wider public domain.</li>
<li>Catalyzing wider participation in decision-making processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Merits :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The model enhances the scope of participation of individuals and communities in debates that affect them and help them build a global alliance.</li>
<li>A community may no longer find itself isolated but may find an ally for mobilizing effective action through this model.</li>
<li>It also creates an effective deterrent for governments and decision-making bodies that are responsive to people&#8217;s opinions to provide better governance.</li>
<li>The model could also be used favorably by the government in a positive manner to encourage public debates on issues where the opinion and expertise of civil society is of great importance and therefore could become a tool to enhance democratic practices and improve governance practices (especially in Developing Countries).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Why is it necessary to have IT infrastructure to implement E-Government? Explain different IT infrastructure needed to implement E-government.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>IT infrastructure is crucial for the implementation of e-governance because it forms the backbone of digital transformation and enables governments to deliver efficient and accessible services to citizens. It supports the development of digital platforms, websites, and applications through which citizens can access government information and interact with services.</p>
<p>Additionally, IT infrastructure facilitates the collection, storage, processing, and analysis of data, ensuring its security, privacy, and integrity. It also provides the necessary connectivity and communication channels for government entities to collaborate, share information, and engage with citizens. Without robust IT infrastructure, e-governance initiatives would struggle to function effectively and provide the convenience, efficiency, and transparency that citizens expect in the digital age.Here are different components of IT infrastructure needed for successful e-government implementation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Hardware Infrastructure:</strong> This includes servers, computers, networking devices, and storage systems necessary to support the e-government applications and services. It involves the setup and maintenance of data centers or cloud infrastructure to host and manage government systems and databases.</li>
<li><strong>Network Infrastructure</strong>: A reliable and secure network infrastructure is crucial for egovernment. It includes network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, along with network connectivity, both internally within government offices and externally to connect with citizens, businesses, and other government entities. Network infrastructure enables data transmission, communication, and secure access to e-government systems.</li>
<li><strong>Software and Applications</strong>: E-government relies on a wide range of software and applications tailored to specific government functions and services. This includes content management systems, customer relationship management systems, e-payment gateways, data analytics tools, and security software. The software infrastructure enables the development, deployment, and maintenance of e-government applications and services.</li>
<li><strong>Data Management Systems</strong>: E-government involves the collection, storage, and management of vast amounts of data. A robust data management infrastructure includes databases, data warehouses, and data backup systems. It ensures secure storage, efficient retrieval, and data integrity. Data management systems also facilitate data analytics, enabling government entities to gain insights and make informed decisions based on the data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Security Infrastructure</strong>: E-government requires a comprehensive security infrastructure to protect sensitive government data, systems, and citizen information. This includes firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, access controls, encryption mechanisms, and security protocols. Security infrastructure ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of e-government systems and prevents unauthorized access or data breaches.</p>

<h2>Section B: Attempt any eight questions.</h2><h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>“E-Governance is to provide SMART government.” Justify this statement .</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>E-Governance, which focuses on using technology to improve government services, aligns with the idea of SMART government. SMART government means setting clear goals, using measurable ways to track progress, finding achievable and relevant solutions, and working within specific time frames. E-Governance aims to achieve these SMART goals by using technology to transform how governments work. It helps make government services more accessible, efficient, and transparent.</p>
<p>By adopting e-governance, governments can set specific targets like reducing paperwork and making services easier for citizens to access. They can measure progress using data and make sure their efforts are on track. E-governance also provides practical solutions that make sense in the digital age, like automating tasks and offering online platforms for citizens to interact with the government. Governments set deadlines to make sure changes happen quickly and meet people&#8217;s needs. Overall, e-governance supports the principles of SMART government by using technology to improve government operations and deliver services more effectively.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the different stages of E-Government life cycle? Explain.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20966" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/life-cycle.png?resize=545%2C448&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="545" height="448"></p>
<p>i) <strong>Project Assessment:</strong> A project assessment is an authorized planning and evaluation process. It is intended to ensure the environmental, social, cultural, and economic well-being of residents and communities is protected from any significant adverse effects that may be caused by a development project.</p>
<p>ii)<strong>Analysis of current Reality:</strong> Another important part of the project is an analysis of current reality. Low project management experience, ad-hoc project management, unclear scope, ad-hoc staffing, etc. are the major problems of an organization.</p>
<p>iii) <strong>Design of the New system:</strong> When we develop the system we need to be on the base of our audiences or user. Same here in e-government, the system needs to be familiar and easy with the public.</p>
<p>iv) <strong>System Construction:</strong> The result from previous stages helps to construct the system. It should cover the requirements, a combined focus on information technology, processes, and end users.</p>
<p>v) <strong>Implementation and beyond:</strong> At this stage end users interact with the system. The main focus at this stage is focus on system maintenance and clear responsibilities.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>What is E-Government maturity model? Describe the various maturity levels.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A maturity model is a method for judging the maturity of the processes of an organization and for identifying the key practices that are required to increase the maturity of these processes. An eGovernment maturity model provides us with guidance on how to gain control of our processes for developing and maintaining eGovernment services and how to evolve toward a culture of excellence in providing and managing eGovernment.</p>
<p><strong>Closed</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Organizations are closed to e-governance. No plans or vision is available.</p>
<p>&#8211; They continue with fully manual and conventional operations.</p>
<p>&#8211; This is the stage when an organization does not use ICT as a facilitator for good governance and has no plans to do so in the near future.</p>
<p>&#8211; This situation may arise due to a lack of exposure to ICTs and associated benefits that again may depend upon a number of reasons: remoteness from the mainstream in terms of location is primary, and lack of resources and strategic thinking could be some of the other issues.</p>
<p><strong>Initial</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; The organization lacks strategic thinking and direction for e-governance at the top level.</p>
<p>&#8211; The effort sustains as long as the enthusiasm of the individual, who initiated it, remains and is often abandoned due to lack of direction.</p>
<p>&#8211; Such organizations generally accumulate hardware without any planning and much of it goes unutilized or underutilized.</p>
<p>&#8211; This level corresponds to the stage when an organization has initiated the automation of its processes but on an ad-hoc(On required) basis.</p>
<p>&#8211; No organized efforts are made to undertake the e-governance initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Planned</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; E-governance is a part of the organization&#8217;s agenda.</p>
<p>&#8211; Strategic thinking and leadership guide the e-governance initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8211; Clear understanding of e-governance needs as projected by the external and internal customers/users.</p>
<p>&#8211; A need assessment study is conducted to prioritize areas of implementation and gauge the extent of e-readiness.</p>
<p>&#8211; Taking input from the assessment study, extensive planning has been carried out indicating policies, strategies, various activities, stakeholders, roles and responsibilities, and resources required in terms of time, money and manpower to undertake the e-governance exercise.</p>
<p>&#8211; However, the organization is yet to enter into the planned implementation of the e-governance exercise, even though all the requisite planning is completed.</p>
<p><strong>Realized</strong><br />
&#8211; This level corresponds to the stage when the organization actually realizes the complete e-governance plan.</p>
<p>&#8211; Consequently, an integrated system is established where all the internal processes of the organization are computerized and there is seamless information exchange among all concerned entities.</p>
<p>&#8211; The organization starts delivering the services to its external as well as internal customers/users in an effective manner.</p>
<p>&#8211; Complete realization of the plan, in a single instance, would entail an enormous amount of resources in terms of time, money, and manpower, which may necessitate adopting a phased approach for the operation of the e-governance services.</p>
<p><strong>Institutionalized</strong><br />
&#8211; At this level, the organizations sustain the realized state over a period of time so that e-governance becomes part of its work culture.</p>
<p>&#8211; The e-governance services are effectively utilized and accepted by the users.</p>
<p>&#8211; Several iterations between planned and realized states lead to institutionalization when e-governance becomes a way of life.</p>
</div>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<div><p><p>How can we achieve good governance through E-Government models? Explain.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>We can achieve good governance through e-governance in the following ways:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Roles and responsibilities:</strong> There should be clarity regarding individual responsibilities, organizational expectations of executives, and the role of executive and steering committees.</li>
<li><strong>Structure and composition:</strong> An executive committee needs to have the right group of people, having particular regard for each individual&#8217;s background, skills, and experience, and how the addition of individuals builds the collective capability and effective functioning of the committee.</li>
<li><strong>Purpose and strategy:</strong> The executive committee plays an important role in setting the vision, purpose, and strategies of the organization, helping the organization understand these, and adapting the plans to implement them.</li>
<li><strong>Risk management</strong>: By putting in place an appropriate system of risk oversight and internal controls, executive committees can help increase the likelihood that their organizations will deliver on their purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Organizational performance:</strong> The executive committee determines and assesses appropriate performance categories and indicators for organization.</li>
<li><strong>Committee effectiveness:</strong> An executive committee&#8217;s effectiveness may be greatly enhanced through careful planning of board-related activities; committee meetings being run efficiently; regular assessments of organizational performance; having an executive succession plan; and the effective use of sub-committees, where appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> The executive committee must ensure there is a flow of information to the board that aids decision-making; there is transparency and accountability to external. stakeholders and employees throughout the enterprise and the integrity of financial statements and other key information is safeguarded.</li>
<li><strong>Organizational maturity:</strong> The executive committee has a role to play in enhancing the capacity and capabilities of the organization they serve.</li>
<li><strong>Culture and ethics:</strong> The executive committee sets the tone for ethical and responsible decision-making throughout the organization.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><p>Define E-readiness. What is legal infrastructural preparedness?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>E-Readiness is the ability to use information and communication technologies (ICT) to develop one&#8217;s economy and foster one&#8217;s welfare. It Is the ability to pursue value-creation opportunities facilitated by the use of the Internet. It is not simply a matter of the number of computer servers, websites, and mobile phones in the country, but also things such as its citizen&#8217;s ability to utilize technology skillfully, the transparency of its business and legal systems, and the extent to which governments encourage the use of digital technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Legal infrastructural preparedness </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>The manual processes in government are usually obsolete, inefficient, and bureaucratic.</li>
<li>Though they have transformed to computerization practices, they continue to have poor and inefficient performance and this is due to a lack of administrative reforms and lack of business process reengineering.</li>
<li>They lack the requisite legislation and legal infrastructure to enable such reforms or reengineering of the existing business practices, rules, and regulations within the government at various levels.</li>
<li>This seems to be accentuated (emphasized) in developing countries while developed countries have been significantly successful in administrative reforms and business reengineering.</li>
<li>The fundamental question that arises here is &#8220;Are the laws and regulations required to permit and support the move towards e-governance initiatives in place? Example: Digital Signature Act</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the challenges to E-Governance security? Explain.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>1. Availability</strong></p>
<p>It is the process of ensuring that information and vital IT services are available when required. Availability concerns affect publishing, interactive processing, transaction processing, and service delivery e-government activities. Following are some availability concerns:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Fault-related availability concerns: </strong>These include hardware faults, changes in program or data structures, and failures in other system facilities that are not computer-based.</li>
<li><strong>Intrinsic availability concerns: </strong>These include unuse of storage and recovery mechanism, failure of magnetic media, and loss of facilities due to physical damage.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of service concerns: </strong>Government services are attractive targets for malicious activities. Denial of service attacks can be launched from a variety of sources and can take a number of forms.</li>
<li><strong>Individual or informally organized hackers: </strong>Most denials of-service attacks against e-government services have been launched by individual or informally organized hackers. Some of these have resulted in significant disruption and expense to the taxpayer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Integrity:</strong></p>
<p>It is the process of safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and software. Integrity concerns affect publishing, interactive processing, transaction processing, and service delivery e-government activities. Following are some integrity concerns:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Data Content Integrity issues: </strong>They are associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of e-government information content. This can involve the modification or destruction of information electronically published by the government or information associated with reports, applications, or other service requests.</li>
<li><strong>Intentional modification of data: </strong>Data may be modified or destroyed within e-government processors (e.g. Web Servers). Penetration may be accomplished by defeating identification and authentication mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Connection integrity issues: </strong>Successful implementation of e-government services requires some degree of confidence on the part of private citizens or other user entities that information being read originated only with the assumed government source and that information  being provided goes only to the appropriate government destination(s).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Confidentiality: </strong></p>
<p>It is the process of protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Impacts or consequences of unauthorized exposure: </strong>The consequences of unauthorized exposure of information via e-government resources depend in large part on the specific information that is exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of confidence in institutions and service delivery mechanisms: </strong>Public disclosure of e-government confidentiality breaches can result in loss of public confidence in e-government mechanisms and in the institutions they serve.</li>
</ul>
