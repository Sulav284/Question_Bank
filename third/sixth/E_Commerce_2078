<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What are the security threats in e-commerce? How client server and data transactions securities are maintained in e-commerce?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>There are several security threats that e-commerce businesses need to be aware of and address to protect their clients and data. Some of the common security threats in e-commerce include:</p>
<p>1. Unauthorized Access: Hackers or unauthorized individuals gaining access to sensitive customer information or the e-commerce platform itself.</p>
<p>2. Data Breaches: Theft or exposure of customer data, including personal information, credit card details, and login credentials.</p>
<p>3. Payment Fraud: Fraudulent activities such as stolen credit card information, identity theft, or unauthorized transactions.</p>
<p>4. Phishing and Social Engineering: Deceptive tactics used to trick users into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.</p>
<p>5. Malware and Viruses: Malicious software designed to infect e-commerce websites or compromise user devices.</p>
<p>6. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: Overloading a website&#8217;s server with traffic to disrupt its operations and render it inaccessible to legitimate users.</p>
<p>To maintain client-server and data transaction security in e-commerce, several measures are implemented:</p>
<p>1. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS): These encryption protocols are used to secure data transmitted between the client&#8217;s browser and the e-commerce server. SSL/TLS certificates ensure that data is encrypted and cannot be intercepted or tampered with during transmission.</p>
<p>2. Secure Payment Gateways: E-commerce businesses utilize secure payment gateways that comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) requirements. These gateways ensure that customer payment information is encrypted, securely transmitted, and processed without exposing sensitive data to the e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implementing additional layers of security by requiring users to provide two forms of authentication, such as a password and a unique code sent to their mobile device.</p>
<p>4. Regular Security Audits and Updates: Conducting routine security audits to identify vulnerabilities and promptly applying security patches and updates to the e-commerce platform, server, and associated software.</p>
<p>5. Strong Password Policies: Encouraging users to create strong, unique passwords and enforcing password complexity requirements. Additionally, implementing measures like account lockouts and password reset procedures to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>6. Monitoring and Intrusion Detection Systems: Utilizing systems to monitor network traffic, detect suspicious activities, and mitigate potential security breaches promptly.</p>
<p>7. Educating Users: Providing guidelines and educating customers about online security best practices, such as avoiding suspicious emails, using secure Wi-Fi networks, and being cautious about sharing personal information online.</p>
<p>8. Regular Data Backups: Performing regular backups of customer data to ensure its availability in the event of a security incident or data loss.</p>
<p>By implementing these security measures and staying vigilant, e-commerce businesses can enhance client-server and data transaction security, mitigate risks, and protect the integrity and privacy of their customers&#8217; information.</p>

transactions electronically, typically through digital platforms and technologies. It involves the<br />
transfer of funds from one party to another using electronic means, such as computers,<br />
smartphones, or other internet-enabled devices.</p>
<p>Online credit card transaction is a type of electronic payment system. There are five parties involved in ana online credit and purchase: consumer, merchant, clearing house, consumer&#8217;s bank and the merchant&#8217;s bank. The steps for online credit card purchase.</p>
<p>1.When a consumer wants to make a purchase, he/she adds the item to the merchant&#8217;s shopping cart.</p>
<p>2. The consumer checks out the purchase through the credit and issued by their bank.</p>
<p>3. Using encryption, a secure connection using SSL/TLS is established and credit card information is sent to the merchant server.</p>
<p>4. Once the consumer credit card information is received by the merchant, the merchant software contacts the clearing house.</p>
<p>5. The clearing house contacts the issuing bank to verify the account and balance of consumer.</p>
<p>6. Once verified, the consumer&#8217;s issuing bank credits the merchant account.</p>
<p>7. The debit to the consumer account is transmitted to the consumer in a monthly statement.</p>
<p>Electronic Cheques</p>
<p>Electronic cheques, also known as e-cheques or electronic checks, are a digital form of traditional paper cheques. It works as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: The sender creates an e-cheque using banking software by filling necessary payment details, such as the recipient&#8217;s name, the payment amount.</p>
<p>Step 2: The sender authorizes the e-cheque by digitally signing it using their private key or providing other authentication credentials and sends it to the receiver through email or any other channels.</p>
<p>Step 3: The receiver receives the e-cheque and deposits it into their bank account using electronic means ex. online banking services, mobile banking apps.</p>
<p>Step 4: The receiver&#8217;s bank receives the electronic cheque and verifies its authenticity and validity and then forwards the e-cheque to the sender&#8217;s bank for clearance and settlement.</p>
<p>Step 5: The sender&#8217;s bank confirms the validity of the electronic cheque and checks the payer&#8217;s account for sufficient funds. If valid, the sender&#8217;s bank deducts the payment amount from the sender&#8217;s account and transfers it to the receiver&#8217;s bank.</p>
<p>Step 6. The receiver receives the amount, completing the transaction.</p>
<p>Stored Value Payment:<br />
A stored value payment system allows users to store funds electronically on a prepaid account and use those funds for transactions. Here&#8217;s how a stored value payment system typically works:</p>
<p>Step 1: Users create an account with the provider of the stored value payment system &amp; load funds into their account by transferring money from their bank account or through other accepted methods.</p>
<p>Step 2: When making a purchase or payment, users initiate the transaction by selecting the stored value payment option and providing the necessary details, such as the transaction amount and recipient information.</p>
<p>Step 3: The payment system verifies the availability of sufficient funds in the user&#8217;s prepaid account to cover the transaction amount.</p>
<p>Step 4: If the funds are available, the payment system authorizes the transaction and deducts the necessary amount from the user&#8217;s balance.</p>

How the potentially unwanted programs like adware and spyware works?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Malicious code refers to any type of code or software that is designed to cause harm, compromise security, or exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications. Malicious code can take various forms, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and more. Potentially unwanted programs like adware and spyware are types of malicious code that typically aim to generate revenue for their creators by exploiting users&#8217; computers or invading their privacy. Here&#8217;s an overview of how these programs work:</p>
<p>1. Adware: Adware is software that displays unwanted advertisements to users. It often comes bundled with free or low-cost software and gets installed alongside the desired program without the user&#8217;s explicit consent. Once installed, adware monitors the user&#8217;s browsing behaviour, collects data, and displays targeted advertisements. Adware can also redirect users to advertising websites or inject unwanted ads into web pages.</p>

</div>
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>How content based and collaborative filtering approaches are used for product<br />
recommendation in e-commerce?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Content-Based Filtering:</p>
<p>Content-based filtering is an approach used for product recommendation in e-commerce that focuses on analyzing the content or attributes of products to make personalized recommendations. In this method, each product is described by a set of relevant attributes such as category, brand, price, color, and size. Similarly, user profiles are created based on their preferences, past behavior, and interactions. The recommendation system then compares the attributes of the user&#8217;s profile with the attributes of available products. By identifying products with similar attributes or content to those preferred by the user, the system generates recommendations. For example, if a user has previously shown a preference for athletic shoes, a content-based filtering system may recommend other athletic shoes with similar attributes such as the same brand, size, or color.</p>
<p>Collaborative Filtering:</p>
<p>Collaborative filtering is another popular approach for product recommendation that relies on the behavior and patterns of multiple users. This method recognizes that users with similar preferences in the past are likely to have similar preferences in the future. Collaborative filtering involves collecting user behavior data such as purchases, ratings, reviews, and browsing history. By analyzing this data, the system calculates similarities between users based on their behavior and preferences. Once user similarity is determined, the recommendation system suggests items that are popular among similar users but have not been interacted with by the target user. For example, if User A and User B have similar browsing and purchasing patterns, collaborative filtering would recommend products that User B has liked or purchased to User A, assuming they would also find those items interesting.</p>
