    <h2>: Attempt all the questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>What is “subject verb agreement” in a sentence? Why is this agreement necessary in any type of writing? Explain it with at least three examples.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Subject-verb agreement</strong> is a grammatical rule that states that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number. In other words, if the subject is singular, the verb should be singular, and if the subject is plural, the verb should be plural. This agreement is crucial in any type of writing because it helps maintain clarity and grammatical correctness, ensuring that sentences are easily understood and free from errors.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Incorrect: The dog and the cat loves to play together.</p>
<p>Correct: The dog and the cat love to play together.</p>
<p>In this example, the subject &#8220;the dog and the cat&#8221; is plural because it refers to more than one animal. Therefore, the verb &#8220;love&#8221; must also be plural to match the subject. The incorrect version has a singular verb &#8220;loves,&#8221; which creates a subject-verb agreement error</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Incorrect: Each of the students are responsible for their own assignments.</p>
<p>Correct: Each of the students is responsible for their own assignments.</p>
<p>In this example, the phrase &#8220;each of the students&#8221; refers to individual students, making the subject singular. Thus, the verb &#8220;is&#8221; should be singular as well. The incorrect version uses the plural verb &#8220;are,&#8221; which is not in agreement with the singular subject.</p>
<p>Example 3:</p>
<p>Incorrect: The book that I borrowed from the library were interesting.</p>
<p>Correct: The book that I borrowed from the library was interesting.</p>
<p>Here, the subject &#8220;the book&#8221; is singular, referring to a single book. Therefore, the verb &#8220;was&#8221; must also be singular to match the subject. The incorrect version uses the plural verb &#8220;were,&#8221; which does not agree with the singular subject.</p>
<p>Subject-verb agreement is necessary in writing to avoid confusion and to maintain grammatical correctness. If this agreement is not followed, sentences may become unclear, and the writing can lose its credibility. Proper subject-verb agreement ensures that sentences are grammatically sound and effectively convey the intended message to the readers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Title: Exploring Computer Setups: A Comparison of Desktops, Laptops, Palmtops, and More </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s fast-paced world, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, catering to diverse needs with varying setups. Each computer type offers unique features and capabilities to suit different user preferences. Let&#8217;s delve into a comparison of the most popular setups, namely desktops, laptops, palmtops, and others, based on their functions, facilities, ease of access, and complexity. <strong>Desktop Computers: </strong></p>
<p>Desktops are powerful and versatile setups, designed for stationary use. They excel in processing-intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming due to their larger form factor and room for high-end hardware. With multiple ports and slots, connecting peripherals is effortless. However, their limited portability restricts usage to a fixed location.</p>
<p><strong>Laptops: </strong></p>
<p>Laptops strike a balance between performance and mobility. They are suitable for both work and leisure, allowing users to be productive on the go. While not as powerful as desktops, they offer convenience with built-in keyboards and touchpads. However, their smaller screens and reduced cooling capacity may affect performance during prolonged usage.</p>
<p><strong>Palmtops/Smartphones: </strong></p>
<p>Palmtops, or smartphones, are pocket-sized computers ideal for communication and light tasks. They offer exceptional portability and instant access to information, making them a go-to choice for mobile professionals and casual users. Nevertheless, their limited processing power and screen size may hinder complex tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Others (Tablets/2-in-1s): </strong></p>
<p>Tablets and 2-in-1 devices provide a mix of laptop and palmtop features. With touchscreens and detachable keyboards, they offer flexibility for various applications. They excel in content consumption and light productivity tasks. However, their processing capabilities might be limited compared to dedicated laptops or desktops.</p>
<p><strong>Ease of Access and Complexity: </strong></p>
<p>Desktops are typically easy to set up and upgrade, given their modular design. In contrast, laptops and palmtops offer a plug-and-play experience with minimal configuration required. However, hardware upgrades in laptops and palmtops may pose challenges due to compact designs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, choosing the right computer setup depends on individual needs and preferences. For power users seeking performance, desktops are the go-to option, while those seeking mobility and versatility may opt for laptops or 2-in-1s. Palmtops and smartphones cater to users on the move, fulfilling essential tasks efficiently. Understanding the distinct features and functionalities of each setup empowers users to make informed decisions, ensuring seamless computing experiences tailored to their requirements.</p>

<h3>Question 6</h3>
<div><p><p>Write two paragraphs on advantages and disadvantages of using such devices like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Android, EDGE using the following expression, on the one hand, in brief, however, moreover, such as, whereas, for example, that is.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>On the one hand, using devices like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Android, and EDGE offers numerous advantages in the field of connectivity and communication. Wi-Fi provides wireless internet access, enabling users to stay connected to the internet without the hassle of cables. Bluetooth facilitates seamless data transfer between devices, making it convenient to share files and media. Android, as a widely used mobile operating system, offers a vast array of applications and customization options, catering to diverse user preferences. EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) technology allows for faster data transmission over mobile networks, enhancing internet browsing and app performance. Moreover, these technologies have revolutionized the way we interact with our devices, enabling smooth multitasking and accessibility to a wealth of information and entertainment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks associated with the use of these devices. For example, relying heavily on Wi-Fi for internet connectivity may lead to security concerns, as unauthorized users might access sensitive data if proper precautions are not taken. Additionally, Bluetooth&#8217;s open nature can expose devices to potential security vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Moreover, while Android offers an extensive range of applications, it is also susceptible to malware and viruses, which can compromise device performance and user privacy. Furthermore, EDGE technology, while beneficial in improving data speeds, may not match the performance of more advanced mobile data networks like 4G or 5G. Thus, users may experience slower data rates in certain areas. Careful consideration of security measures and being mindful of the limitations of these technologies is essential to fully enjoy their advantages while mitigating potential risks.</p>
