    <h2>SECTION A: Attempt any TWO questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain the modern approach to system analysis and design.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>System analysis and design are the complex, challenging, and simulating organization processes that a team of business and system professionals uses to develop and maintain computer-based information systems. It is an organizational improvement process. Information systems are built and rebuilt for their benefit.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Joint Application Design (JAD) :</strong></p>
<p>JAD is a structured process in which users, managers and analysts work together for several days in a series of intensive meetings to specify or review system requirements. It is a management process – a people process – which allows IS to work more effectively with users in a shorter time frame. Because of bringing the people directly affected by the system in one place and time, time and organizational resources are better managed. Also, group members develop a shared understanding of what the system is supposed to do. The JAD process also includes approaches for enhancing user participation, expediting development, and improving the quality of specifications.</p>

<p>fig : Joint Application Design</p>
<p><strong>Advantages :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>JAD decreases time and costs associated with requirements elicitation process.</li>
<li>Creative idea production and improved user ownership of the system.</li>
<li>Rapid development of systems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>JAD requires a large block of time to be available for all session participants.</li>
<li>Requires significant planning, scheduling effort and stakeholder commitment of time and effort.</li>
<li>Requires trained and experienced personnel for facilitation and recording.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <strong>Agile model</strong> :</p>
<p>This model is an intuitive approach to the waterfall model. Multiple development cycles take place here, making the life cycle a “multi-waterfall” cycle. Cycles are divided up into smaller, more easily managed iterations. Each iteration passes through the requirements, design, implementation and testing phases. A working version ofsoftware is produced during the first iteration,so you have working software early on during the software life cycle. Subsequent iterations build on the initial software produced during the first iteration.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-39062 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Agile.drawio.png?resize=262%2C225&amp;ssl=1" alt="- Hamro CSIT" width="262" height="225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>fig : Agile development Model</p>
<p><strong>Advantages : </strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>In this model customer can respond to each built.</li>
<li>More flexible – less costly to change scope and requirements.</li>
<li>Easier to test and debug during a smaller iteration and manage risk because risky pieces are identified and handled during it’s iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Total cost is higher than waterfall.</li>
<li>Needs a clear and complete definition of the whole system before it can be broken down and built incrementally.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prototyping</strong> <strong>: </strong></p>
<p>Prototyping is an iterative process of systems development in which requirements are converted to a working system that is continually revised through close work between an analyst and users. Designing and building a scaled-down but functional version of a desired system is the process known as prototyping. Prototyping is part of the analysis phase of the systems development life cycle. It is the process of building a model of a system.</p>

<p>fig : Prototype Development Model</p>
<p><strong>Advantages :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Useful for projects in which user requirements are uncertain or imprecise.</li>
<li>It encourages active user and management participation.</li>
<li>Projects have higher visibility and support because of the extensive user involvement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages :</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Incomplete or inadequate problem analysis.</li>
<li>It increases lifetime cost to operate, support and maintain the system.</li>
<li>Practically, this methodology may increase the complexity of the system as scope of the system may expand beyond original plans.</li>

<h3>Question 9</h3>
<div><p><p>A system costs Rs. 2,00,000 to install and Rs. 10,000 per month as recurring expenses. The benefit per year is 1,50,000. Assuming an intrest rate is 15%, what is the payback period of the investment?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>given,</p>
<p>initial installation cost = Rs. 2,00,000</p>
<p>Recurring expenses per month = Rs. 10,000</p>
<p>Annual benefit = Rs. 1,50,000</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>Recurring expenses per year = Per month recurring expenses x 12 = 10,000 x 12 = Rs. 1,20,000</p>
<p>Total annual cost = Rs. 2,00,000 + Rs. 1,20,000 = Rs. 3,20,000</p>
<p>Net annual benefit = Rs. 1,50,000 &#8211; Rs. 1,20,000 = Rs. 30,000</p>
<p>As net annual benefit is less than annual benefit. so, the payback period will be calculated as,</p>
<p>$$Payback period = \frac{{installation-cost}}{{Net annual-benefit}} = \frac{{2,00,000}}{{30,000}} = \frac{{20}}{{3}} = 6.67 years$$</p>

<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>Define feasibility study. Explain different categories of feasibility.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A feasibility study is an analysis and evaluation of the practicality, viability, and potential success of a proposed project or business venture. It assesses various aspects, including technical, economic, legal, operational, and scheduling factors, to determine whether the project is worth pursuing.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Technical Feasibility –</strong><br />
In Technical Feasibility current resources both hardware software along with required technology are analyzed/assessed to develop project. This technical feasibility study gives report whether there exists correct required resources and technologies which will be used for project development. Along with this, feasibility study also analyzes technical skills and capabilities of technical team, existing technology can be used or not, maintenance and up-gradation is easy or not for chosen technology etc.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Feasibility –</strong><br />
In Operational Feasibility degree of providing service to requirements is analyzed along with how much easy product will be to operate and maintenance after deployment. Along with this other operational scopes are determining usability of product, Determining suggested solution by software development team is acceptable or not etc.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Feasibility –</strong><br />
In Economic Feasibility study cost and benefit of the project is analyzed. Means under this feasibility study a detail analysis is carried out what will be cost of the project for development which includes all required cost for final development like hardware and software resource required, design and development cost and operational cost and so on. After that it is analyzed whether project will be beneficial in terms of finance for organization or not.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Feasibility –</strong><br />
In Legal Feasibility study project is analyzed in legality point of view. This includes analyzing barriers of legal implementation of project, data protection acts or social media laws, project certificate, license, copyright etc. Overall it can be said that Legal Feasibility Study is study to know if proposed project conform legal and ethical requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule Feasibility –</strong><br />
In Schedule Feasibility Study mainly timelines/deadlines is analyzed for proposed project which includes how many times teams will take to complete final project which has a great impact on the organization as purpose of project may fail if it can’t be completed on time.</li>

<h3>Question 12</h3>
<div><p><p>What is Use Case Modeling? Explain with example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Use Case modeling is used for analyzing the functional requirements of a system. It focuses on what the system does or the new system should do. A use case model is developed in the analysis phase of the OODLC. A Use Case model describes what a system does without describing how the system does. It reflects the view at the system from the perspective of a user outside of the system. A Use Case model partitions system functionality into behaviors (i.e. Use Cases) that are significant to the users of the system (i.e. Actors).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
