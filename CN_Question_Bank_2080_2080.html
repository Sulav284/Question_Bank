    <h2>Section A: Attempt any two questions.</h2><h3>Question 1</h3>
<div><p><p>What is classless addressing? Explain distance vector routing with a suitable example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Classless addressing, also known as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), is a methodology used in IP (Internet Protocol) addressing to allocate and manage IP address space more efficiently. It is an improvement over the traditional class-based addressing (Class A, Class B, and Class C) that was used in the early days of the internet.</p>
<p>In classless addressing (CIDR), IP addresses are not confined to strict class boundaries. Instead, IP address blocks can be subdivided into smaller subnets, allowing for more flexible allocation of IP addresses. CIDR notation is used to represent IP address blocks and their associated subnet masks. CIDR notation typically looks like this: IP_address/prefix_length, where the prefix length specifies the number of bits in the network portion of the address.</p>
<p>For example, consider the IP address 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. In CIDR notation, this would be represented as 192.168.1.0/24, where the &#8220;/24&#8221; indicates that the leftmost 24 bits represent the network portion of the address, and the remaining 8 bits are used for host addressing. This allows for more efficient allocation of IP addresses and routing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Distance Vector Routing</strong></p>
<p>Least-cost route between any two nodes is the route with minimum distance.<br />
• Each node maintains a set of triples(Destination, Cost, NextHop)<br />
• The table at each node(router) also guides the packets to the desired node by showing the next stop in the route.<br />
• There are 2 steps in the route learning process<br />
1. Initialization<br />
2. Sharing</p>
<p><strong>1. Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Initially routing table in each node consists of the distance between itself and its immediate neighbors, those directly connected to it. Not directly connected is marked infinities.</p>

<p><strong>2. Sharing (Update)</strong></p>
<p>2 types of sharing(updates):</p>
<p><strong>1. Periodic</strong></p>
<p>Directly connected neighbors exchange(share) updates periodically (on the order of several seconds).</p>
<p><strong>2. Triggered</strong></p>
<p>Whenever the table changes.</p>
<p>Each update is a list of pairs: (Destination, Cost). The routing table will compare old routing table values with the shared table. Updating of routing table is based on minimum cost.</p>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<div><p><p>What is flow control? How does stop-and-wait ARQ protocol handle error? Where does this protocol reside in OSI layer?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Flow control is a mechanism used in data communication and networking to manage the rate of data transmission between two devices or systems. Its primary purpose is to prevent congestion and ensure that data is sent at a rate that the receiving device can handle, preventing data loss and degradation of network performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stop and wait ARQ</strong></p>
<p>Stop and wait ARQ protocol handles errors through the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>When a frame is sent, the sender starts the timeout counter.</li>
<li>If acknowledgement of frame comes in time, the sender transmits the next frame in queue.</li>
<li>If acknowledgement doesn&#8217;t come in time, the sender assumes that either the frame or its acknowledgement is lost in transit. Sender retransmits the frame and starts the timeout counter.</li>
<li>If a negative acknowledgement is received, the sender retransmits the frame.</li>
</ol>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-25736" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/frame.jpg?resize=239%2C355&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="239" height="355"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stop-and-wait ARQ protocol resides at the <strong>data link layer (Layer 2)</strong> of the OSI model.</p>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain TCP header with a neat diagram. Highlight on its uses.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-25739" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TCPSegmentHeader-1.png?resize=456%2C395&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="456" height="395"></p>
<p>The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) header is a critical part of the TCP/IP suite and is used to control the transmission of data between two devices over a network. It contains various fields that provide essential information for establishing, maintaining, and terminating TCP connections. Below, I&#8217;ll explain the different fields in a TCP header:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Source Port (16 bits):</strong> This field identifies the sender&#8217;s port number, which is used to differentiate between multiple applications running on the same sender device. It helps the receiving device know which application should receive the incoming data.</li>
<li><strong>Destination Port (16 bits):</strong> This field specifies the destination port number on the receiving device. It tells the receiving device which application should process the incoming data.</li>
<li><strong>Sequence Number (32 bits):</strong> This field is used for ordering and reassembly of segments at the receiving end. It contains the sequence number of the first data byte in the current segment.</li>
<li><strong>Acknowledgment Number (32 bits):</strong> If the ACK flag is set (indicating that this segment is an acknowledgment), this field contains the sequence number of the next byte the sender expects to receive. It acknowledges receipt of all data up to this sequence number.</li>
<li><strong>Header Length (4 bits):</strong> This field specifies the length of the TCP header in 32-bit words. It is used to determine where the data begins in the TCP segment.</li>
<li><strong>Flags (9 bits):</strong> Various control flags are used to manage the TCP connection:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>URG (1 bit):</strong> Indicates that urgent data is present in the segment.</li>
<li><strong>ACK (1 bit):</strong> Indicates that the acknowledgment number is valid.</li>
<li><strong>PSH (1 bit):</strong> Push Function. It instructs the receiving device to push the data to the application immediately.</li>
<li><strong>RST (1 bit):</strong> Reset the connection. It is used to abort a connection or reject an invalid segment.</li>
<li><strong>SYN (1 bit):</strong> Synchronize sequence numbers. It is used to initiate a connection.</li>
<li><strong>FIN (1 bit):</strong> Indicates the sender has finished sending data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Window Size (16 bits):</strong> This field specifies the size of the sender&#8217;s receive window. It indicates the number of bytes the sender is willing to receive before expecting an acknowledgment.</li>
<li><strong>Checksum (16 bits):</strong> This field is used for error checking. It covers both the header and data fields to ensure data integrity during transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Urgent Pointer (16 bits):</strong> If the URG flag is set, this field indicates the offset from the current sequence number where the urgent data begins.</li>
<li><strong>Options (Variable Length):</strong> This field is optional and can contain various TCP options. Common options include Maximum Segment Size (MSS), Timestamps, and Window Scale. The length of the options field is determined by the data in the Header Length field.</li>
<li><strong>Padding (Variable Length):</strong> If needed, this field is used to ensure that the header length is a multiple of 32 bits. Padding is added to the options field to achieve this.</li>
</ol>
<p>The TCP header is followed by the data being transmitted. Together, the header and data make up the TCP segment. The TCP header plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliable and ordered delivery of data between devices in a TCP/IP network.</p>

<h2>Section B: Attempt any eight questions.</h2><h3>Question 4</h3>
<div><p><p>What do you understand by packet switching? Explain. What are its advantages and disadvantages?</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>Packet Switching</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>A switching technique in which message is sent in one go, but it is divided into smaller pieces and they are sent individually.</li>
<li>The pieces are called packets.</li>
<li>Each packet is given a unique number to identify their order at receiving end.</li>
<li>Every packet contains some information in its headers such as source address, destination address and sequence number.</li>
<li>Packets travel across the network, taking shortest path possible.</li>
<li>Packets are reassembled at receiving end in correct order.</li>
<li>If any packet is missing or corrupted, message is resent.</li>
<li>If correct order of packets is reached, the acknowledgment message is sent.</li>
</ul>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-25741" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/switchh.png?resize=411%2C138&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="411" height="138"></p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Packet switching is cost effective.</li>
<li>Offers improved delay characterisitcs.</li>
<li>Packet can be rerouted if any problem occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>More complex.</li>
<li>If packet gets lost, sender needs to resend the data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<div><p><p>Explain different types of network types.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>A <strong>peer-to-peer (P2P) network</strong> is a type of decentralized computer network where individual devices, called peers, communicate and share resources directly with each other without relying on a central server. In a P2P network, each device has equal status and can function both as a client and a server, allowing for the sharing of files, services, or information among the connected peers. Here are the key characteristics and features of a peer-to-peer network:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> P2P networks have no central authority or server that controls the network. Instead, all connected devices have equal importance and can communicate with each other independently.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Sharing:</strong> One of the primary purposes of P2P networks is to share resources among peers. These resources can include files, such as documents, music, videos, and software applications. Peers can access and download these resources from other peers.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Computing:</strong> P2P networks are often used for collaborative tasks and distributed computing. Peers can combine their processing power to solve complex problems or perform calculations, making them suitable for tasks like scientific research, distributed simulations, or cryptocurrency mining.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> P2P networks are inherently scalable. Adding more peers to the network does not require significant central infrastructure. The more peers that join, the more resources and computing power become available.</li>
<li><strong>Redundancy and Fault Tolerance:</strong> Data and resources in a P2P network are often replicated across multiple peers. This redundancy enhances data availability and fault tolerance. If one peer becomes unavailable, others can still provide the required resources.</li>
<li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Some P2P networks provide a degree of anonymity, as users can share and access resources without revealing their true identities. This anonymity is often associated with file-sharing applications.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Common examples of P2P networks include BitTorrent for file sharing, cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin (which utilize P2P principles), instant messaging applications like Skype (in its early P2P form), and some decentralized blockchain networks.</li>
</ol>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25743" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/download.png?resize=241%2C209&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="241" height="209"></p>
<p>A <strong>client-server network</strong> is a centralized computing architecture in which devices or computers are categorized into two distinct roles: clients and servers. These roles define the way devices interact with each other and share resources. Here&#8217;s an explanation of a client-server network:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Clients:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Clients are the end-user devices or software applications that request services, resources, or data from servers.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Client devices can include personal computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, and even software applications like web browsers and email clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Servers:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> Servers are specialized computers or software applications designed to provide services, resources, or data to clients. Servers are powerful machines optimized for reliability, scalability, and high availability.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Common types of servers include web servers (for hosting websites and web applications), file servers (for storing and sharing files), email servers (for sending and receiving emails), and database servers (for managing and serving databases).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Key Characteristics of a Client-Server Network:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Centralization:</strong> The network architecture is centralized, with servers acting as central repositories of resources and services. Clients connect to servers to access these resources.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Servers are responsible for storing, managing, and maintaining resources such as files, databases, applications, or web content. Clients make requests to servers to access these resources.</li>
<li><strong>Client Requests:</strong> Clients initiate requests to servers to perform specific tasks or retrieve data. Servers respond to client requests by providing the requested services, data, or resources.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Client-server networks often implement security measures to control access to resources and protect data integrity. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are commonly used to ensure that only authorized clients can access specific resources.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Scalability in client-server networks often involves adding more servers or upgrading existing servers to handle increased client demand. This allows networks to accommodate growing user bases and resource requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability and Redundancy:</strong> Servers are designed for reliability and can have redundancy built in. Redundant servers and backup systems ensure that services remain available even if one server fails.</li>
<li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> To distribute client requests evenly across multiple servers, load balancers may be used. Load balancers help prevent any single server from becoming overloaded, ensuring optimal performance.</li>
<li><strong>Examples:</strong> On the internet, websites are hosted on web servers, email is handled by email servers, and files are often stored on file servers. These servers collectively provide services to clients using a client-server architecture.</li>

<h3>Question 8</h3>
<div><p><p>What is socket programming? Explain tocket bucket algorithm with an example.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p>Socket programming is a programming paradigm that allows processes running on different devices to communicate over a network using sockets. A socket is a software endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. Socket programming enables developers to create network applications that can establish connections, exchange data, and perform various network-related tasks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a high-level overview of socket programming:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Socket Creation:</strong> To establish communication, a socket is created on both the client and server sides. These sockets can be bound to specific IP addresses and port numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Connection Establishment:</strong> A client socket initiates a connection request to the server socket by specifying the server&#8217;s IP address and port number. The server listens for incoming connection requests and accepts them.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transfer:</strong> Once a connection is established, data can be exchanged between the client and server using read and write operations on the sockets.</li>
<li><strong>Connection Termination:</strong> After data exchange is complete, the connection can be terminated gracefully.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>Token Bucket Algorithm</strong> is a network traffic management and shaping mechanism used to control the rate at which data is transmitted or processed in a network. It&#8217;s often employed by routers, switches, and network devices to regulate the flow of data, ensuring that it adheres to a specified rate limit. The Token Bucket Algorithm uses two main components: the token bucket and tokens.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Token Bucket:</strong> The token bucket is an imaginary bucket that contains a certain number of tokens. Tokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate (token generation rate). The bucket has a maximum capacity that limits the number of tokens it can hold.</li>
<li><strong>Tokens:</strong> Tokens represent permission to transmit a certain amount of data. Each token corresponds to a fixed unit of data (e.g., bits or bytes). Tokens are removed from the bucket whenever data is transmitted. If there are no tokens in the bucket, data transmission is delayed until tokens become available.</li>
</ul>
<p><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone  wp-image-25749" src="https://i0.wp.com/hamrocsit.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C176&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="176"></p>
<p>Suppose you have a network device with a token bucket algorithm configured with the following parameters:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Token generation rate: 10 tokens per second.</li>
<li>Maximum bucket capacity: 100 tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, imagine a data source that wants to transmit data at a rate of 5 packets per second, with each packet consuming 8 tokens.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>Initially, the token bucket is filled to its maximum capacity of 100 tokens.</li>
<li>The data source sends its first packet, which consumes 8 tokens from the bucket. The bucket now contains 92 tokens.</li>
<li>The data source continues to send packets at a rate of 5 packets per second. As each packet is sent, it consumes 8 tokens from the bucket.</li>
<li>If the bucket runs out of tokens while the data source is still transmitting, the data source must wait until new tokens are generated at the rate of 10 tokens per second.</li>
<li>Tokens are added to the bucket at the token generation rate, gradually replenishing the bucket. Once there are enough tokens, the data source can resume transmitting.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>SNMP, or Simple Network Management Protocol,</strong> is a widely used network protocol for managing and monitoring network devices and systems. It enables administrators to collect information, monitor network performance, and configure network devices remotely. SNMP operates in the application layer of the OSI model and is commonly employed to manage networked devices such as routers, switches, servers, printers, and more.</p>
<p>Here are the key components and concepts associated with SNMP:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Managed Devices:</strong> These are the network devices or systems that you want to monitor and manage. Managed devices have SNMP agents installed, which are responsible for collecting and storing information about the device&#8217;s status and configuration.</li>
<li><strong>SNMP Manager:</strong> The SNMP manager is the system or application responsible for managing and monitoring the network. It uses SNMP to communicate with the SNMP agents on managed devices. The SNMP manager can retrieve data from managed devices, configure them, and even trigger actions based on specific events or conditions.</li>
<li><strong>SNMP Agent:</strong> The SNMP agent is a software component installed on each managed device. It collects and maintains information about the device&#8217;s hardware, software, and network parameters. When queried by an SNMP manager, the agent provides information about the device&#8217;s current status and can perform tasks like changing configuration settings.</li>
<li><strong>Management Information Base (MIB):</strong> The MIB is a hierarchical database that defines the structure and organization of data accessible via SNMP. Each managed device has its own MIB, which describes the specific parameters and values that can be monitored and controlled. The MIB uses a tree-like structure with numerical object identifiers (OIDs) to uniquely identify each parameter.</li>
<li><strong>SNMP Operations:</strong> SNMP supports several operations that the manager can perform on managed devices:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>Get:</strong> The manager retrieves specific information from the agent by specifying the OID of the desired parameter.</li>
<li><strong>Set:</strong> The manager can modify configuration settings on the agent by sending a request to change a specific parameter.</li>
<li><strong>GetNext:</strong> This operation is used to retrieve the next OID in the MIB, facilitating efficient navigation through the MIB tree.</li>
<li><strong>Trap:</strong> The agent can send SNMP traps or notifications to the manager to report events or issues, such as network failures or security breaches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>SNMP Versions:</strong> SNMP has evolved over the years, with different versions offering varying levels of security and functionality. The most commonly used SNMP versions are SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3. SNMPv3, in particular, provides enhanced security features such as authentication and encryption.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 had limited security measures, making them susceptible to unauthorized access and data interception. SNMPv3 introduced security enhancements, including authentication and encryption, to protect SNMP communication.</li>

<h3>Question 11</h3>
<div><p><p>Highlight on the use of PPP. What are the functions of Media Access Control.</p</p></div><div><strong>Answer:</strong><br><style>body .mathjax_wrap{width: 100%;overflow-x: scroll;margin-bottom:10px;}</style><p><strong>PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):</strong></p>
<p>PPP, or Point-to-Point Protocol, is a widely used data link layer protocol in networking. It is primarily used for establishing a direct connection between two nodes over various physical mediums, including serial cables, telephone lines, and more. PPP serves several important functions in networking:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Data Link Layer Protocol:</strong> PPP operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It provides a method for encapsulating and transmitting data over a physical link between two devices.</li>
<li><strong>Authentication:</strong> PPP supports various authentication methods, including PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) and CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol). These methods ensure that only authorized users or devices can establish a connection.</li>
<li><strong>Error Detection and Correction:</strong> PPP includes error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure data integrity during transmission. This helps in detecting and recovering from errors that may occur due to noise or interference on the communication channel.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Protocol Support:</strong> PPP is not limited to a single network layer protocol. It can encapsulate various network layer protocols, including IP (Internet Protocol), IPv6, IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange), and others. This flexibility makes PPP suitable for a wide range of network configurations.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> PPP allows devices at both ends of the connection to negotiate parameters such as authentication methods, network layer protocol to be used, and other settings. This negotiation ensures that both devices agree on how the connection will be established and maintained.</li>
<li><strong>Link Control:</strong> PPP includes Link Control Protocol (LCP), which manages the establishment, maintenance, and termination of the PPP link. LCP ensures that the link is functional and monitors its quality.</li>
<li><strong>Network Control:</strong> Network Control Protocol (NCP) is used to configure and manage the network layer protocols running over the PPP link. For example, IPCP (IP Control Protocol) is used for configuring IP addresses.</li>
<li><strong>Compression and Encryption:</strong> PPP supports data compression and encryption for efficient use of bandwidth and enhanced security, respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic IP Assignment:</strong> PPP can dynamically assign IP addresses to the connecting devices, allowing for flexible and efficient IP address management.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Functions of Media Access Control (MAC):</strong></p>
<p>The Media Access Control (MAC) is a sublayer within the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It is responsible for managing access to the shared communication medium in a network segment where multiple devices are connected. The primary functions of MAC include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li><strong>Addressing:</strong> MAC assigns unique hardware addresses (e.g., MAC addresses in Ethernet networks) to each network interface card (NIC) in the network. These addresses are used for identifying devices within the same network segment.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Formatting:</strong> MAC encapsulates data packets into frames that can be transmitted over the network medium. It adds header and trailer information to each frame, including source and destination MAC addresses, frame length, and error-checking information.</li>
<li><strong>Media Access Control:</strong> MAC protocols define rules for accessing the shared communication medium. These protocols ensure that devices take turns transmitting data to avoid data collisions. For example, Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to manage access to the network medium.</li>
<li><strong>Error Detection:</strong> MAC includes error-detection mechanisms to identify corrupted frames during transmission. If a frame is detected as having errors, it may be discarded or retransmitted.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Control:</strong> Some MAC protocols implement flow control mechanisms to regulate the rate of data transmission between devices, preventing data overload or network congestion.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> In networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, MAC can prioritize certain types of traffic over others, ensuring that critical data gets transmitted with higher priority.</li>
<li><strong>Address Learning:</strong> In switched Ethernet networks, MAC tables are used to learn and store the association between MAC addresses and switch ports. This helps in forwarding frames only to the appropriate destination port.</li>
<li><strong>Broadcast and Multicast Handling:</strong> MAC handles the distribution of broadcast and multicast frames to all devices within a network segment.</li>
